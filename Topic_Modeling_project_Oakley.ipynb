The big display is easy to read in a wide variety of outdoor conditions and is not cluttered by features that you never use.  The stopwatch (with 100 lap memory) is very practical for running laps or races.  The big buttons are easy to use when your fingers are cold or wet and they are labeled to help you figure them out quickly.  Two separate clocks let you easily switch back and forth between timezones when you're traveling.  The rubber watch band is comfortable and durable.

The case needed to be hard enough to withstand being in my backpack and perhaps being crushed. The medium size looks completely different (it's a crescent shape) from the default picture on this page, but you can search around to get the actual picture.The case is definitely hard enough so that I wouldn't worry too much about crushing the sunglasses. However, I would worry if I accidentally sat on them; I don't think it's made to handle that kind of force.The medium size case perfectly fits the Crosshair 2.0 from Oakley, without any unneeded space.

Great deal!', 17: \"There's absolutely no point to buying a $100 pair of sunglasses over a pair of $10 sunglasses.  After having lost this pair of Oaks I came to this realization.

Since the majority of my training is solo, an mp3 player comes in handy on those, I-really-don't-want-to-train-today, days.  This is my second player; my first being a Creative Nomad.  It is a hassle when my Nomad headphone wires come loose and start swinging everywhere.  I don't have that problem with this product.  Bottom line is that the Thump is the bomb...but so is the price.  On long training runs and rides, I have music at my fingertips without those messy wires getting in the way.  During overcast days, I simply flip the lenses up for better vision.  I'm sure I look weird with the lenses up but that doesn't bother me to much.  Right now all is right with the world and I love my new shades.

Oakley has made fine products since ever! this is my third large vault and it suits the task!

Just be careful you don't drop them.  They don't like falls.

However, wearing these at night is virtually impossible, so I purchased this case. First test, in the first few days I. Was riding at night, and this large case slipped out of my pocket, took a dent, but my expensive Wind Jacket Shades were just fine. The only con I can think of is it's rather large diameter, it's bigger than a sixteen ounce water bottle, more like a twenty ounce coke. It fits into winter jacket pockets quite easily, but it may only be stashed in the large pocket of cargo shorts come summer. This is great protection though.\", 42: \"I wear glasses 24/7, I have several pairs of Oakleys also. This case is large and can handle most frames. It's not 'bullet proof&#34;, but if a gets dropped it will be fine. It can handle some weight and pressure too, but it wouldn't hold up to being stomped or run over by a car.\", 43: 'Very well built case. Was surprised it was metal actually but it really is and very large. To give you some scale this case fits just slightly loose in my cup holder in my ford focus. I feel completely safe leaving my Oakley glasses in this case.', 44: 'First off this thing is HUGE!  As another reviewer said it will not fit properly in your car.  I put it in the cup holder, which works fine for me.Other than it being huge to carry around it is worth it.  I put the sunglasses in the bag and then in the case.  keeps them scratch free.', 45: \"This is really a great case. Overall durable and sturdy.  The only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5 is because the hinges feel a little cheap and even though oakley claims they should fit my glasses (c-wire's) the case is a little to big and they move around a little more than i would like.  Other than that great case strong solid snap upon closing and great quality lining inside the case.\", 46: \"Product exactly as described. EXCELLENT protection for your expensive Oakleys. The case is meant to look worn so don't panic (like I did) when you open the box and it looks like it's been run over by a truck LOL!\", 47: \"Got here fast! Looks great and the sunglasses are very protected in this case. Also, it looks smaller on the picture, but once you get it; it's larger than you expected.\", 48: 'Good afternoon .. I have a question I would like to know if this kit works for oakley crosshair lenses ..? thanks', 49: \"The case is good.  It isn't as spring loaded to shut as I'd like but it's certainly solid and strong enough to ride in the saddle bag and protect my sunglasses.  I wear bobster foamerz and bobster desperados and they barely fit in the case, but they DO fit and these are bigger sunglasses.  I would recommend this to someone looking to protect their sunglasses because it's the best I've found thus far.\", 50: \"I have a pair of Oakley Fuel Cell sunglasses. I wanted something to keep them in that would protect them and this seemed like the best option for that since it's metal. This vault provides all the protection anyone could want but does have it's drawbacks. First off it's BIG. This makes it difficult to stash just anyplace in the car (fit's pretty good in a cup holder) and definately will not fit in your pocket. It is perfectly round and smooth which have two drawbacks; if your fingers are slick it can be hard to open the case as there are no tabs or indentations to get a hold of and if the surface you set it down on is not flat, it will take off on you. Not major problems given the amount of protection they give your glasses but it's all nice to know. I leave my Fuel Cells in the bag they came with and put them in the case. It takes some time but who wants to but another pair of expensive glasses if you can help it.\", 51: 'Its a great product, but it bends a little, and its fixable, since its aluminum, really good for bike riding, or hiking.', 52: 'Very solid case with a very modern design. Purchased this for a teenager who has totally destroyed every other eyeglass case that we have purchased. THis one has held up so far so kudos on the durability.', 53: 'I own the Oakley Antix and these fit the case perfectly.  Protects it in my bag without crushing the glasses.', 54: 'Great Case For The Money, Protects Like No Other,  Gets a lot of looks, Just a bit big.  Perfect for your bag.', 55: 'bought this not knowing what to expect. i have oakley fuel cells and they fit perfectly in this case. a lot better than i would have expected. very rugged and keeps glasses safe. i throw this in my book bag and they keep glasses looking new. must have for anyone with oakleys.', 56: \"It was a gift for my husband and he didn't seem too thrilled with it. I love it though...it looks cool, very unique and definitely protects your sunglasses. I might re-gift it to myself! If you're looking for something crazy looking, kinda like a big bullet then this is for you. It's definitely a conversation starter, too.\", 57: 'the product arrived in very good conditions and it look like the same as the picture. other thing is the time it took to arrived at my home', 58: \"It is ok product to buy but it doesn't look like original Oakley product. But it is cute looking. Buy it\", 59: 'Just as advertised', 60: 'My little bro loved it for his new glasses and it really protects it shipping was real fast', 61: \"I recently bought a pair of Oakleys and being the OCD kind of person I am, I bought this to protect them when not in use for long period of time. I gotta say, the case excels at that rather well. It provides full protection all around from almost anything you can throw at it while keeping a nice, felt-like inside as to not scratch or mark up the shades themselves. I also rather like the look it has, it gives it a worn-out and used appearance over the metal outside and it only makes me thing it'll last a long time before I need another case. I love it and carry it with me regularly in my car. Highly recommended if you want to make your expensive sunglasses last a while.\", 62: 'I bought this for the Oakley Scalpel and they fit perfectly in them.  The only thing you have to be careful about is closing the lid done on the lenses.  Oh and your finger.  The lid closes with some pop.', 63: \"works great for my sunglasses typical Oakley product top of the line as usual cannot go wrong with it. recommend for anyone who wants to keep expensive oakley's safe and scratch free\", 64: \"This case is the gas tank for my Fuel Cells by Oakley. I can't think of a better case to protect a nice pair of glasses\", 65: \"I needed a large case to hold my glasses and sunglasses so I picked up 2 of these. They are more than big enough for my frames (I have a large head so my glasses frames are pretty wide laterally). I like this case because it is virtually crush proof (within reason of course) and has a nice interior. It is slightly padded and felt lined so that once your glasses are in there you can throw it around without worry of breaking your expensive eyewear. I would have preferred that they did not put the studs/spikes around the exterior, it looks kinda lama (overly aggressive) and also makes the case prone to damaging other items. For example if you through your case into a bag with your laptop and your phone, it may scratch those up a bit. I won't detract this at all from the rating though because I bought this case to protect my shades, not my laptop - and it protects my eyewear brilliantly.\", 66: 'Just purchased a pair of polarized Pit Bulls and wanted a nice case for the dresser to store them.  The fit is great but would really like to have the bottom more flat since the case has a tendency to roll when bumped.  When added to the glasses this would make a great gift presentation.  Okay but I ordered the soft vault for travel.', 67: \"I love it, I bought a nice pair of Oakley's and I am hoping to make this pair last a lot longer than the last. Previous pair was sat on by your's truly.Should last for a while, good solid construction, hinge is nice and long, interior is slightly padded in a nice cloth. Gonna run mine through a polisher to make it bright and shiny.\", 68: 'This metal casing will work well with my Hijinx and Split Jacket! It looks tough really! My friend wants it too!', 69: \"The case seems to provide good protection for the sunglasses.  It's not the most convenient case to carry around, but left in the car, it works fine.\", 70: 'I did like this case, it is very durable, protective & a very rustic design.  Works well with oversize oakleys & has a felt protection inside to ensure that you glasses do not get scratched.  Pricey, but worth it.', 71: 'Great vault, my Oakley Plaintiff safe now! Never got so big, so safe, so great looking vault for my sunglasses!', 72: 'This case is very well built and has a very strong locking spring. When you consider the quality of this case, the cost is less than I would have expected.', 73: 'Oakley has the best sunglasses in my opinion and I have to add that their sunglass case is great too. A bit large but you wont mind in the fact that they protest your investment in your sunglasses. Actually a pretty cool looking case (but I am going to bling it up to look more feminine!', 74: 'I purchased this case for the Monster Dogs. The glasses fit perfectly. Not only does this case look and feel bad ass but it also keeps your glasses very safe.', 75: 'The Oakley pitbulls that I own fit perfectly in this case. This is a must have......the protection with this case is outstanding.', 76: \"I purchased the Oakley Large Metal Vault because I wanted a safe secure place for my new Oakley Juliet sunglasses, but they just aren't big enough for that, unfortunately. Which is too bad, because it was a great price and the Vault is a well built glasses storage unit. I don't think a nuclear holocaust could damage that thing. I was sad to have to return it, but if I could find a metal vault that would fit my glasses, I would buy it. So, long as the price was reasonable, of course.\", 77: 'This is an original Oakley case.

Yay for me!\", 79: 'The perfect fit for my Oakley Big Taco sunglasses that did not come with its own case.  The case is large so it does not fit inside pockets easy.

It is extremely strong and strudy and I would expect it to break under the circumstances, not designed to take that pressure. That said while the case was knocked out of shape by me falling on it, the glasses inside were protected, happy days.Delivered quickly, good price', 88: 'Easily one of the best gifts my wife has ever given me.  This is a handsome watch, just oozing with style.  Not perfect, but an outstanding dress watch.Cons:-Heavy.  If you like a solid feel, this might not be a con.  Even liking a solid feel, this one is close to the maximum acceptable weight.-Thick.  Dress watchs tend to be very slim but this one is around 13 mm (over 1/2\") thick.  I\\'m used to clunky watches, so this doesn\\'t bother me.-Vibration.  The most significant shortcoming.  Although not a traditional automatic watch, it has a flywheel/ratchet thingie to charge the battery.  The mechanism for this has a fairly significant vibration even compared to a traditional mechanical automatic watch.Pros:-Style.  OK, I\\'m not a huge Oakley fan, and it is rare for anything to catch my eye to this degree, but Oakley has some outstanding design folks, and this is some of their best work.  Sleek enough to hide the thickness, unique and distinctive without being ostentatious.-Functional.  The maximum functionality while being a dress watch, hour, minute, and sweep hands, and a date window.  It seems accurate, and lets you know when it needs to be worn (to charge it) by making the second hand move irregularly when the battery is low.-Environmentally/technophile sensitive.  The intertial generator for the watch eliminates the need for batteries, which are a HAZMAT.  At the same time, this is a neat bit of mechanism, with a window so the flywheel can be seen, hence the technophile factor.I love it, but one can see that it is not for everyone.  This might explain why Oakley discontinued it, but mine will never be for sale.', 89: \"I bought these sunglasses for my son for his 15th birthday.

I like them because they are lightweight and provide the kind of wrap-around style and coverage I am looking for in sunglasses.  I lost my second pair in a public restroom; set them down then forgetfully left them behind.  Returned 5 minutes later and they were gone.  If I lose this pair, that will probably be it.  They are just too expensive.Take a look at the DeWalt glasses offered on Amazon.  You will laugh at the price differential, but you will stop pretty quickly once you order a pair and give them a try.  I have five pair now and don't care if lose a pair.  For the price, fashion recognition and name brand exclusivity hold no sway over me.  And the DeWalts are almost as light and comfortable as the Oakleys.  Sorry Oakley, but you guys have priced yourself right off of my &#34;gotta have&#34; list.\", 94: 'i think this r the best for cyclinggood coverage no mud get ingood coverage no wind get in', 95: 'My dad wore the original pair of these I bought him to the ground.

Order was shipped quickly and efficiently to us.', 99: \"Love this OTT watch. Heavy, shiny and wide enough for a bloke. It's certainly not for the shrinking violet but, for those middle aged geezers like myself who refuse to grow old gracefully, it's top banana. As per usual for Oakley it's not the cheapest in the world and it is made in China, although to be honest the build quality seems no less than my Tag. I guess you pay for the name - but isn't that always the way with fashion? I like it and my son is after it as well. If you are in the market for something different and not too overpriced for a watch then this would fit the bill admirably.\", 100: 'These are great! So light you forget you have them on and they hug your face ever so slightly keeping them from sliding down when I am on my bike.

They are extremely light and comfortable. They have a sleek cool look to them. They come with interchangeable nose pieces. They are by far one of the most comfortable glasses I have ever worn. I have had other Zero's in the past and they never disappoint.  You have to be very careful with these though b/c they do not have a frame around the lenses. After a few minutes of wearing them, you can easily forget that they are even there.I highly recommend these glasses, especially if comfort is your primary concern.\", 103: 'Half Jackets.. What can I say. Up until a few days ago, I carried the same pair into combat zones and hotspots all over the world. From my time as a grunt to a private contractor to a shooting instructor..You\\'ve deflected shrapnel, sand, dust and mud- even some stray shotgun pellets. My face may be scarred, but my eyes are intact. It was a huge, HUGE moment of sadness when I realized I could not find my original pair yesterday, and had to order a new set. You are the only Oakleys I know that I can wear with any outfit and not look like a complete \"tacticool\" doofus. Thank you.', 104: 'I bought a pair of these many years ago.

It is way too cool and you will be amazed.  They are great shades.  Good luck!', 109: 'In May of 2007 I purchased these same sunglasses from Oakley.com. At the time these glasses were going for over 120 bucks. I recieved these glasses a few weeks later. And to say the least these glasses are tough.

Thanks I hope this helps.', 110: \"I LOVE these glasses.  Bought them about a year and a half ago and I used them this morning on the drive to work.

Of course Oakley never fails to impress customer about their products. And buying it through Amazon have the better deal than buying it from Oakley itself. The only thing I gave the product 4 stars is because of the Free Gift option, you rather do the gift wrapping cause the only different is that the box is in different Tape packaging and have the note. Other than that nothing really special and the price went up after I've been monitoring and checking the prices from different websites, 2-3 months ago its 100 dollars cheaper than any other website but it went back to $895. If I know they will go up I should have bought it couple of months ago. I guess its the holiday season thats why it went up. Anyway over all the watch is looks great. I bought it as a gift for my husband. Its a great buy.\", 113: 'These shoes are not only cool but very comfortable and look really good on my feet..', 114: \"If awesome were accurately defined in the dictionary (it is not), you'd see the Oakley Whisker Iridium Sunglasses as definition number one.I'm a big fan of practical accessories and these sunglasses are definitely in top 10 list. I've been to a number of very sunny locations around the world and these glasses never fail to keep my eyes happy. Apart from being the epitome of awesomeness, the design really contributes to its functional role of protecting my eyes from the sun. And since it curves with contour of your face, you get very little light leakage - if any.Practicality aside, these glasses look utterly awesome. Admit it, you know it's true. ;)I do however have two complaints about these glasses (gasp!) which forced me to dock one star from my review:1) When these glasses are on, they stay on. This is a good thing.. however it stays in place by having a really snug fit. if you're planning on wearing them for 5-6 hours at a time, be prepared to experience some discomfort right above your ears. It can be irritating at times, especially if you're on a long day hike or road trip. I believe the technical term for this is cranial pressure. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, it's the equivalent of a child waking up Christmas morning to a dead hamster in box as their present. Not fun. :(2) The glasses only came with a a soft storage pouch. I was a little disappointed because I had spent quite a bit of money on these and expected some sort of hard case to protect my investment. These aren't some cheapo sunglasses found at your local drug store for $9.99. I had an additional case at home so I went ahead and used that.These minor complaints caused me to dock one star from the overall product review. Don't get me wrong though. These glasses are still the epitome of functionality. In that arena they still get a 5/5. In terms of comfort though, I'd have to give Oakley a 4/5. Hopefully this matter will be considered when engineering the next generation of awesomeness.\", 115: \"They look great, I don't get tired using them, they protect my eyes from the sun. What else can I ask?\", 116: 'Como todos los lentes de OAKLEY elegantes , comodos y actuales. Los recomiendo , calidad sinonimo de precio.

Nice quality, sleek, simple look. I would recommend to others.', 119: 'I already knew how they would fit from owning a polarized pair. These are comfortable for me, but may not be for others.', 120: 'This is my second pair of \"Whiskers\" sunglasses from Oakley.  My first pair gave me 4 years of year round, hard usage, had been sent back for a bent frame (my fault) once and several pairs of new lenses.  Finally lost the original pair in the Atlantic Ocean ......  I ordered these from Amazon after calling and consulting with Oakley directly.  I was advised by the salesperson @ Oakley that as long as the Whiskers were \"fulfilled by Amazon\" (and \"not some mom & pop store\") that they should be legit.  So, I went ahead and ordered them.  Upon arrival, I too found that the inside temple was marked \"CHINA\".  So, again I called Oakley.  I was advised by the salesperson @ Oakley that they do indeed have some of their products made outside of the USA, and Whiskers are made in China.  He stated that it was a misconception that all Oakley products are USA made. I was able to register my Whiskers on Oakley.com, and now the warranty is extended to 2 years.Going back to the sunglasses themselves, these are a low profile pair of sunglasses.  They sit close to the face with a slight \"wrap\" design to the lenses, allowing for a close fit, decreasing sun \"leaking\" in around the edges.  I purchased the black frames with the black \"iridium\" lenses.  I personally do not like polarized lenses because of the effect polarization has on the true color of things (especially the blue/green spectrum - seems to make things appear unnaturally bright to me, and definitely changes the color saturation).  So, since I prefer a very dark lens which does NOT alter the reality of the colors in nature, these are perfect for me.  These lenses are great for anywhere where light reflection/glare is an issue (water, snow, etc.).  I get headaches from too much glare, and these glasses with the iridium lenses never let me down.  I find them very comfortable, allowing me to wear them for many hours at a time.  The only \"negative\" might be, that I personally would not wear these for any kind of sport; while they have high quality, impact resistant lenses, the frames are not designed to take a beating.  As a parting comment, I am a woman, and I prefer the style of these glasses over the huge, \"Jackie O\", rhinestone encrusted style sunglasses that are so common for women.  These fit my angular face very well, and they fit like a glove, never slipping off of my nose.', 121: \"I'm usually cautious ordering certain things online, and especially something that is counterfeited as much as Oakley sunglasses, but I'm very happy.

They were pewter in color with the smoke gray lenses. Well, a couple months ago, I stuck them in my breast pocket on my jacket, went to work, and at some point the top metal piece of the frame, right above one of the lenses, snapped completely in half, leaving me with some very expensive broken glasses in my pocket.Called Oakley, even know I knew the glasses weren't under warranty, hoping they could at least sell me a frame. They told me the frame costs $70, but I'd have to buy it from the optometrist. Went to the optometrist where I bought the prescription glasses, and they wanted over $200 to replace the frames, and said it would take 2 weeks to get the frames in, box it all up, ship it to Oakley for repair, and get them back. I called their bluff and left without falling for it.Hopped on Amazon that night, found these for $100, bought them, and they were here two days later. Grabbed my small screwdriver set, removed two screws, removed the lenses, put my corrected lenses in, tightened the screws back down, and $100 and 30 min of work later, I had nice new frames on my corrected lenses, and honestly, I like the black frame better than I did the pewter frame.Anyways, all that said, I like the Whisker series of glasses, and would recommend them, even if you're just looking for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses.\", 128: \"The pros- looks great (on me!), light, with great optics. Optics are better than most brands with polarized lenses. They fit well on my narrowish face. Despite careful scrutiny, the finish is flawless. The frames grip well and tend to stay on my face despite some light sweating.The cons- looks cheap. Hard to explain why...its metal gray finish perhaps. Its light weight and slender design somehow makes it look fake. The Oakley logo, normally large enough on its products to be seen a mile away, is inconspicuous here. Depending on your point of view, that maybe a good thing.The rubberized grip is another issue. It certainly grips well but not in a comfortable way. The grip is pretty tight too, and soon becomes bothersome around my nasal bridge and more so at my temples. Perhaps its all part of the sporty nature of these glasses.Regardless, putting on these glasses is a far less pleasant experience than putting on my Ray-Bans. Which admittedly cost 3 times more. Once on my face, its tolerable. But only for an hour or so. I'm somehow always relieved to take them off. My Ray-Bans, with it's heavier polarized glass (not plastic) lenses and bigger metal frames have a reassuring weight and heft to them, yet are super comfortable to wear. Half the time, I'm not even aware I'm wearing them.So, would I buy them again? Probably not, and thats squarely due to the comfort factor. I've stared at these glasses long enough to find them very well made, appreciated the finish on the glass bits, and worn them long enough to confirm that these are indeed superior lenses.Plus, the wife likes them....\", 129: \"I have owned many pairs of Oakleys, Ray Bans, and other designer sunglasses. I have a big head which usually poses a minor issue when wearing sunglasses for an extended period of time. My had size is 7 1/2 and these sunglasses fit perfectly and are extremely light and minimalistic. These have a nice modern slick look. I bought them and am 23 years old and my father like them so much he bought a pair as well.One person mentioned they are uncomfortable behind the ears and on the nose after an extended time - I don't share this opinion and haven't felt this.You won't be disappointed by these shades\", 130: 'I bought these because I needed something I could use regardless of what I was wearing. These are sporty yet not over the top like some other Oakleys. These have a nice classy, understated look that goes with quite a lot of apparel.  They do fit fairly tightly around the head.  This may or may not be a good thing for you. It is not an issue for me, but I can definitely see where it might be annoying to some.  Mine arrived slightly askew when put on (you could see it when you lie them flat on a table). This was easily fixed by very slight bending pressure to adjust them properly. Definite recommended product.', 131: \"My husband had a pair of these previously and loved them.

He had the original box along with receipt and after some conversion with the oakley Rep. they said if it was from neglect it would cost him $99 (I believe) if it was a default with the glasses it would be $79. He was able to convince them how disappointed he was with Oakley and he would just go back to RayBan, at that point they would do him a FAVOR and he could send them back to them and they would take care of this.

Luckily, I was able to find them cheap on Amazon (I no longer need Rx, so the Oakley lenses suffice for me now).I have a round face, so the aviator style of glasses don\\'t work for me, they end up covering half my face and look silly.  The Oakley Whiskers however are a more streamlined wrap around design and compliment my facial features nicely.  I\\'ve received many compliments wearing them.Functionally, they are awesome.  Blocks out sunlight effectively, and they stay put when I\\'m wearing them even while playing sand volleyball.  They are pretty rugged for a metal frame, but also look very stylish for when I\\'m not playing sports and am dressed to impress.  My only complaint is that Oakley appears to be phasing these out; in 2006 there were several lens and frame color options.  Today there is only one lens option, and I think 2 frame colors (black or pewter).  Hopefully I won\\'t lose this pair, though I am considering ordering a back up now just in case they do go out of production.I\\'ve heard/read other reviews stating that these are a bit on the small side, however as stated above I do have a small face so these fit me perfect.

If you're paying a high price for these lenses (and I don't know how you could avoid doing so) than you better make sure you take every precaution not to scratch them. If you care for them well, they are a very nice accessory.

I went through about a dozen cheap pairs that I picked up from local brick and mortar stores. Sitting here I realize that, if I were to add up the cost of all these cheap sunglasses, I could of bought a couple of very nice pairs. I have only owned cheap sunglasses and I wondered if paying a premium on sunglasses is worth it.Enter the Oakley Mens Whisker sunglasses.I picked these up because they came to my attention being apart of a sale. I was hesitant due to even the sale price but, as I mentioned beforehand, just a few cheap pairs would cover the cost of these glasses.They arrived in the mail and come pre-packaged in a simple cardboard box. Within the cardboard box the glasses are protected in a soft cloth bag and also contain a cleaning rag and small info brochure.I immediately pulled out the glasses and spent the next few hours walking around trying them on and, have to say, I am pretty impressed.Many of my cheap glasses broke due to poor construction of the frames. These frames feel durable and like they will last. I have a large head that does put tension on glasses. These glasses were able to take the tension yet retain their original shape.The glasses are not polarized but do a good job on their own protecting my vision from the suns glare. The lenses are the perfect tint and did not block out my vision of the outside world.I received compliments from my wife and neighbors about how stylish the glasses look. It reminds me of the hoopla during the 80\\'s when Tom Cruise sported \"Aviator\" glasses from the movie Top Gun and the craze he created.PRO:++ Durable construction++ Compliments on how stylish they lookCON:++ For price, only receiving a cloth bag for protection is cheapCONCLUSION:These glasses are well worth the premium paid over regular sunglasses you find sitting on a carousel rack at the local brick and mortar stores.

They are either too small or angled in a way where they sit uncomfortably on my face.  Not with these.  These fit perfect out of the box with no adjustments.  Perfect size, perfect coverage.  I only wish they were a bit darker.  You can't see my eyes with them on, but they are no where near as dark as my old school Gargoyles.  They are very lightweight.  The special ear rubbers are super sticky...a bit irritating to my shaved scalp, but I know that once they are on, they are not going anywhere.  I would highly recommend these to anyone with a rather large head looking for a quality pair of sunglasses.

These fit perfectly.  And they're cute.  I just wish there were more frame and lens colors.\", 173: \"I visited the Oakley store with my 2-year-old and inquired about toddler sized sunglasses.  The sales person suggested the Men's XS Fives.  I ended up purchasing them on Amazon for a better price than the Oakley Vault (outlet store).  They fit my 2-yr-old, but also can fit a narrow adult face.  I'm a small frame female and wear the regular women's Oakley Fives.  I have worn these Men's XS Fives a few times but I don't think they provide enough shading for an adult, so I think they are better fit for a toddler.\", 174: 'These will only fit correctly if you are buying for someone with a narrow face. If you are buying for someone (child or adult) who regular size sunglasses fit correctly, these are not for you (or them). That said, they are stylish and functional; just wish they had the spring hinge like most styles of Oakleys (the earpieces on these glasses just operate on a standard hinge).', 175: 'Order the Oakley XS for everyday use ended up wearing the oakely fishing great sun blockers with style. Only issue is nose bridge room but a good tight fit great for boating or riding', 176: 'I always find Oakley sunglasses too big for my head. I look like I have bug-eyes.

Great customer service through Oakley too.', 177: \"I bought these for my wife, whose head is much too small for normal, adult sunglasses.  She loves them.  These are real sunglasses, not the junk that's usually sold as children's sunglasses, and they're one of the few pairs of sunglasses that actually fit my wife.\", 178: \"The sunglasses and it's build quality are everything you'd expect from Oakley.  It wasn't clearly labeled that the XS Fives are meant to fit a smaller face (child or petite adult).  The XS stands for &#34;extra small&#34;.I bought these to replace a pair of lost sunglasses.  I wanted a snug fit.  A family member who is an optometrist recommended that I buy these sunglasses in brown or amber tint for winter and night driving. The lens provide better contrast in these driving conditions.  Overall, a great buy!\", 179: \"I had the black pair in the same style for several years, and loved them.  I lost them out on the lake, and decided to try the amber frames.  They are really nice.  Probably not high quality looking if that is what you want, but my main reason for getting them is that I have a fairly small head/face.  These fit perfectly, where most sunglasses, even women's sizes are just too big for my face.  So I would only recommend these if you have a small framed face.  Otherwise, you probably won't like them.\", 180: \"I purchased these because I have a small face, and my ladies Oakleys rub hard behind my ears, and are too long on the sides.  After much consideration, I ordered these.  I am glad I did! The front is the same size as 2 other models of ladies Oakleys I have and I am fond of this style because they're stylish and they fit under the brim/bill of a baseball cap.  I will be looking for more of this frame style with darker lenses.  They sides measure 1/2&#34; shorter than my ladies ones, and the ladies ones rub in an uncomfortable way that gives me a headache.  I wore these all day Saturday to my son's baseball tournament, and they were very comfortable.  I suggest that before ordering these that people read all of the reviews.  If you're a smaller framed person, these are perfect for you!\", 181: 'I have tried Oakley glasses and never found a nice fitting frame other then wires that has a higher price tag for smaller heads.

I compared them to the Oakley Bottlecap sunglasses I got from the Oakley store and, while there are some discrepancies, they are very minor.I like the way they fit. They are for people with a small to meduium width face. They have been discontinued and theOakley Men's Bottle Rocket Oval Sunglassesis the new model. The Bottle Rocket fits me a little better but it is twice the price.I like the Bottlecaps just fine. These will do as a good pair to grab on the go that I don't have to worry about too much. Replacement lenses (Oakley Bottle Cap 13 Polarized Rimless Sunglasses) are still available from Oakley, so I can customize them easily in the future.The G30 lenses are great. I have no complaints about them.From the Oakley store, the G30's appeared to be more of a blue lens when looked at from the front, and a rose lens when looked at from the back. These seem to just be a rose colored lens, through and through.Either way, they work fine and they look good.\", 193: \"I love these glasses. Fit well, they don't bend like wire glasses so they take a beating. Love the fact that you can interchange lenses\", 194: 'Very comfortable, great at cutting down uv', 195: \"Great sunglasses!! I had been putting off buying a nice pair of sunglasses for a long time but I'm glad I fianlly pulled the trigger. Got a great deal and couldn't be happier.\", 196: \"I ordered the GasCan sunglasses both because I prefer polarized lenses for driving and because the wide areas on the temples might block the sun from hitting my eyes from the sides late in the day. There are many late days to and from work where the setting summer sun just cannot be blocked no matter how I adjust my car's visors. In those cases, and many others, GasCans do the job admirable. The tortoise shell design is classy enough for meeting clients yet bold enough to wear on my V-twin cruiser. And after propping the GasCans up on your head in a dark bar room, the large, shiny gold icons let the ladies know you don't mind dropping some coin. Ka-Ching!!! The fact that there are so many replacement lenses available out there (both OEM and aftermarket) is another bonus. Bifocals or prescription lenses are obtainable, if not cheap. Overall, as with all my Oakley sunglasses, I'm very happy with my purchase.\", 197: 'These are the real deal. Great glasses. Love the polarized lenses . This is my 3rd pair. If your looking for GasCans This is a good place', 198: \"My first pair of Oakley and I should be getting  another Oakley too. Beautiful. These pair are comfortable.

Really good customer service', 202: \"I purchased my Polished Gascan 2s over a year ago and they still look brand new! At first i was weary about buying a cheaper pair of plastic Oakleys. They have been dropped over and over and still stand the test of time. If you have a tiny head and play a lot of sports these Sunglasses aren't for you. These are better suited as casually worn shades. I enjoy wearing them while i cruise the town or walking my dog. The UV protection and lenses are second to none for the price. Your eye's are important so buy yourself a good pair of Sunglasses and spend the $90. I recommend you keep them in the slip-case provided to ensure cleanliness and years of good eye protection. But in the end looks and comfort are what sell these awesome sunglasses. I suggest you try before you buy as well.

I didn't want to pay that much, so I bought them here.  I also got prescription lenses for them at the local dealer that I didn't purchase the frames from, and they're great.  I've always had a great experience with this manufacturer, and highly recommend their products.

This pair was lost :(The frames are awesome because they allow some sun thru to reduce 'raccoon eyes'.They are made in USA -- big name competitor brands are mostly made in China.I bought some floppy $50 'sport' glasses from a popular camping store that were supposedly for activity use -- the lens fell out after 6 months of regular use.Great value. Just don't lose them. Buy an Eyewear Retainer to keep them from falling off.\", 215: 'My husband loves these for everyday.  They are great for driving as they block the rays from all angles.  They are also really comfortable for people that have really big heads/faces.  Alot of glasses are too small for him but these work great.

These came today and I wore them while driving.  I must say they're a good pair of glass for the big head folks like me.

I recommend these.\", 219: \"These are great sunglasses- I bought them for my husband for father's day.  The only issues he's had with them is the straight earpiece.  They don't curve around your ear, so when you lean forward, they fall forward.

So I decided to take a sort of a gamble and buy more a more expensive pair. Knowing of Oakley's reputation with quality from coworkers I decided to buy from them, and boy am I glad.First off I got the Black Iridium and grey polarized lenses. The black is not the glossy black but is a flat black finish. It does leave oil marks on it though. The polarized lenses do reduce glare, and they do a pretty good job doing it too. The glasses themselves have a nice agressive street style to them that I really like. The glasses also come with a microcloth bag that you use to store them in. You also clean the glasses with it. The lenses are not the darkest I've had but they still get the job done.All in all these are probably the best sunglasses I've ever had. Definately recommend buying these if you are looking for a great pair of sunglasses that also look pretty cool.\", 224: \"I've been looking for over a year for sunglasses for my husband, because he doesn't really wear any sunglasses because we're never able to find a style that fit him.

They fit perfectly and do a nice job of reducing glare, you can even look directly at the sun without your eyes boiling out of your sockets or something haha. I've dropped them twice since I got them and they don't scratch at all, you can't beat the Oakley name and for this price you should buy two!\", 229: 'hi thanks excellent lenses hope you have good optics and can see well under the hot sun ....hi thanks excellent lenses hope you have good optics and can see well under the hot sun ....', 230: 'Muy buen producto, despacho muy rapido.

The glasses themselves are nice, sweet looking and most of all very durable.

Great pickup.', 240: \"I purchased the Gascans about two years ago (Summer of 2011) from an Oakley store but I can now say that I've thoroughly tested them and I desperately needed to tell someone else how much abuse these bad boys can take. I am a Patrol officer for a city Police department and wear the cans on duty. For starters I have dropped them at a height of over 6 feet to solid concrete on more than one occasion and all they did was take a bounce or two with no scratches or breaks. I have dropped them in the woods, mud, and water. I have actually sat on them and after all this still no warping or breaks or scratches. I have on many occasions worn them to the shooting range and during high dynamic training. Still going strong. The point I want to make about the shooting range that I don't think the description did on here is that they meet the shatter requirements for most ranges. To sum it up if you want some shades that are not going to fall apart but still look pretty dang good then you have found them.\", 241: 'I bought these as a gift for my husband after breaking his other ones, and a year later and they are still going strong.

The matte plastic is almost scratch resistant. I was moving and managed to rub the glasses frame across the wall as I was squeezing up the stairs and thought I scraped them. However, after I inspected them, I realized the glasses took the paint off the wall and the plastic underneath was undisturbed.I threw them into my backpack without putting them in the provided slip cover and now the lens have slight scratches in them. Alas, they still work great but I'll be more careful with my next pair.\", 246: \"I bought these as a Christmas present for my husband, and he loves them!  He has never bought himself a high quality pair of sunglasses, so it is an entirely new experience for him.

I'm quite a bit smaller than you. I didn't know it when I bought these glasses with my prescription in the lenses, but they are men's. How surprised do you suppose *I* was?  What I love about these glasses is that they cover the sun at EVERY angle.  They also eliminate blocked vision by keeping all frames beyond my range of vision.I agree with 'Big' that, if I bend too much, they'll fall off my head.  I am not a big-headed small woman. :o)  But for the most part, Oakley knew exactly how to make the perfect pair of sunglasses for little me.And I don't see anything but clear vision in my glasses, but that might be because these are prescription lenses.\", 278: 'I was worried about paying so much for sunglasses but honestly, I have a fat head and these are the only style glasses that fit my head. These glasses are awesome especially since they are polarized. I do not know how I have gone so long with out polarized lenses.', 279: 'I just purchased a pair of Oakley Gascan\\'s at my local Sunglass hut. Mine are a bit more flashier than these, with some sort of subtle, dark gray, inscribing on the frames. Mine also came with Emerald Iridium lenses. I have a slightly larger head (7 3/8 or so) and a longer hairstyle. The woman that assisted me in my purchase even told me that they fit my face well and looked great. I couldn\\'t agree more.These glasses fit my head securely with no parts of the frame in my field of vision.  I mainly wear my glasses while biking, driving, walking around, and hanging out by the pool. I also plan on using these when I go snowboarding this coming winter.I used a different version of the gascan when I was deployed to Iraq on two occasions. They served me well aside from the fact that they did not completely block out sand, particularly from beneath the frame, on windy days. These glasses aren\\'t intended to completely seal off airborne elements though, so no big deal.My set of shades included an Oakley bag in white, labeled \"Oakley Custom\".I have read some reviews stating that their Oakley\\'s creaked, scratched easily, or felt cheap. This should not be the case. Amazon is, in my experience, a trustworthy business but for those of you who ordered outside of Amazon and Oakley be wary of counterfeits. I have come across numerous counterfeit versions of Oakley glasses that are incredibly accurate. Comparing the best fake to the real thing, you can tell which one is real, by feel alone. Please don\\'t fall victim to counterfeit merchandise. You\\'ll be glad you paid the $100+ for the real thing from a reputable dealer.', 280: 'Very happy with purchase I have worn them almost everyday.. would definitely buy again for the price.. item arrived in good condition and pretty quick', 281: 'I love them and I would recommend to anyone looking for some awesome glasses.

I would love to say these are nice sunglasses.\", 283: \"I bought these for my fiancee and he absolutely loved them! They fit him perfect, and he looks great in them. In fact, he wears them all the time! (Sometimes he wears them when it's really not even sunny anymore.)\", 284: \"Only had these for two weeks or so, but these look awesome and work well in the sunlight. Got them for a sailing trip this summer. Only problem when I got them was a plastic-plastic rubbing with the arms of the glasses that made an obnoxious squeaking noise, but it was nothing 'lubing' up with water and drying off couldnt fix.\", 285: 'These are the best sunglasses I have ever bought.Actually, I have bought two pairs as I wore out the first pair by not taking good enough care of them...I really like the way they make my face look (I am a little oval in the face - with very little hair on top...)Just the perfect company on a sunny day!', 286: 'These sunglasses by Oakley are great.

I highly recommend them.', 287: 'I lost my first pair and think enough of these great glasses to buy another pair. The polarized are perfect for sunny Colorado.', 288: 'These glasses are nice besides the lenses could have been made darker.  I like how they fit.  They are quite hard to break in but they are light and do not cut into your skin around you ears.', 289: 'Great product, a little small for my large head. Aside from that no flaws!! I would recomend this product if interested in Oakley. If you have a large head/face consider a larger model.', 290: 'I purchased these to replace a pair of Hijinx I lost. They are on the lower side of price for polarized Oakleys but same quality and optical clarity.I would buy them again for sure.', 291: 'These glasses work really well they protect your eyes from the sun, which protects you from getting eye diseases its a really smart choice to by this.', 292: 'The sunglasses are very nice,the only flaws I noticed are finger prints from the oil on your hands appear appear easy also this model is for a smaller face.  IF YOU HAVE A BIG HEAD DO NOT ORDER THESE. THERE IS A BIGGER MODEL', 293: 'This item arrived on time and was exactly what we ordered.  The price was good and my son loves them.', 294: 'Absolutely the best pair of sunglasses that I have ever owned.  I liked the gascan,  but thought that the sides were too big.  This is the smaller version and the sides are still large, but not as big as the gascan.  Fit is perfect and the only regret I have is that I did not get the polarized lenses.  Saved a litte money and got the sunglasses that I wanted, so what else could you want?', 295: \"I just bought a second pair of GasCans to replace a pair that blew of my face this past weekend on the Intimidator 305 at Kings Dominion (totally my fault, can't blame the glasses for this). I had the first pair for about 4 years and upon buying them they quickly became my favorite glasses even though I have several pairs of other more expensive Oakley and Ray Ban sunglasses.These glasses look good, fit great, provide fantastic viewing coverage, and are nearly indestructible. The arms have popped off a few times but pop right back on like nothing happened.The one thing keeping them from getting 5 stars from me is the long term comfort of the ear pieces. After wearing them all day the do begin to make the tops of my ears sore but this is true with just about every pair of glasses I own (and is really only a problem when you wear them for more than 5 or 6 hours straight (something I actually do quite a bit).\", 296: \"Oakley Gascan Men's Polarized Lifestyle Sportswear Sunglasses - Color: Matte Black/Black Iridium, Size: One Size Fits All.

I originally went to buy a pair in a store and I bought a pair with grey unpolarized lenses and they just didn't block enough sunlight from my eyes so I figure that if I'm paying $90 for a pair of premium sunglasses sun light shouldn't be an issue. I returned them for a full refund. Then I came on here and found this great deal. I bought the matte black with black iridium polarized which in store or on oakley.com would have cost me $150 but I got them for $104. I chose one day shipping which did cost me an extra $20 but I wanted to make sure I got them before I went away but it was still a good deal. if your looking for a pair of oakley gascans I highly recommend these.\", 298: 'Glasses were just as expected and alot cheaper than the last time i bought them at sunglass hut!!

I have had trouble with many other brands stems hanging up on the helmet padding (by the ear). These slip in without any interference and are extremely comfortable.The polarized lens is a bonus around water but at times refract light through helmets wind screen (causing dark spots).As I said before, I bought these glasses to wear with the helmet but now I wear them exclusively.

I don't mind paying extra for the polarized lens as I get view than the standard lens. Oakley is the only brand sunglasses I wear now.\", 305: 'These sunglasses have great protection. They curve just enough to block the sun from creeping in along the sides. The iridium coating gives them a cool look. My only complaint is that for 150 bucks they could have enclosed an actual hard case rather than just one of those cheap cloth bags.', 306: 'I consider these to be one of the better sunglasses on the market they provide amazing protection from the sun.', 307: 'This sunglasses are very cool and nice, looks great, have a great quality and durability, looks like the picture published!', 308: \"If you have a big melon like me, these are the glasses for you! Most i've found are too small and make my head look even more enormous, but these fit the bill. A bit rockstar, but full functional. The black iridium lenses are perfect for super sunny/ glare filled days. Block out all the stay lasers of sunlight, keep your field of vision sharp and in focus, and you look sweet doing it.I drive truck for a living, and on clear sky bright days, couldn't ask for anything better. Well worth the investment. Only down side i guess is the Iridium layer on them aren't nearly as scratch resistant as standard lenses, but makes up for it in added crispness and clarity.\", 309: 'Mate material makes this product very elegant.

The Lens is very clear and you can see things perfectly through them.  No clouding or darkening to the point you hamper visabilaty.  Just make sure you only use the cloth inside box to clean them or you might scratch the lenses. This goes for any glasses/sunglasses you buy. Microfiber cloth is the best.', 334: \"There's really nothing to complain about with these glasses. They look good and fit well. I get compliments on them all the time. They are easy to maintain and seem quite scratch resistant. The only knock is that they are light weight compared to other Oakleys I've owned. They have kind of a ... cheaper ... feel to them. And for Oakleys they ARE cheaper, so it shouldn't have come as a surprise, which is why I didn't take a star off. Once I got over the light feel I actually came to like it because they aren't overbearing to wear all day, again, unlike some other Oakleys I've owned. So buy with confidence, just don't expect a pound of high grade material when you take them out of the box. And your face will thank you for the lighter weight. After all, it's hot out, and what good would a heavy metallic frame be when it's 112 out!Other info, I have a slightly larger, oval shaped head and these fit great.\", 335: 'Love these glasses.

I searched around the net and several places suggested this particular Oakley style. To my surprise they fit very well, a bit snug but very comfortable. I am assuming they will stretch a bit after use. As far as optics they appear to be some of the better ones I have ever tried. Colors still are distinguishable and my eyes do not strain much in the sunlight.', 337: 'It Was the exact size for me.. I like very much the style. Perfect fit....

It did seem after a few days one of the arms made an awful squeaking sound, but I put Oakley lens cleaner in it to lubricate it and it did the trick! Other than that very happy about my purchase!! Must buy!', 352: \"Very pleased with this pair of Oakleys. I've always loved the Gascan style, loved it for years.  The crystal frame is awesome, since I'm a female in the military, sometimes it's nice to have a different look than all the guys with the black Oakleys. Don't get me wrong, I love my traditional black Oakleys too, and of course have  two pair. But for the price, these are awesome. Lenses are just the right amount of grey, even for my very light blue eyes. I'd have to get the black lens for brighter days, peak sun, but I am lucky to get partial cloud cover most of the time.Only reason they don't get five star in my book, is sometimes, they don't fit snugly on your head. If you bend over they can slip off, and they wont stay on top of your head if you slide them up to peak under the frames. I'll see about having them adjusted, and for field work, a shades rope to secure them at all times.Fantastic design for periphery protection of your eyes, and lens color to protect sensitive light eyes.  :)\", 353: \"Years ago I had a pair of Raybans that I loved. Since then, I've only bought cheap sunglasses because I lose them so frequently. I finally decided to go for another pair of expensive glasses. It was completely worth the money. I read these sunglasses were tight and squeeky. I haven't had either problem. I have a huge head and can never get a hat that is big enough; these sunglasses are snug, but comfortable. The polarized lenses are great and worth the extra money. The best part for me is that driving to and from work every day, the sun is on the left, blinding me for the most of the trip as the road weaves and curves. The wide temples completely block the sun so that I am not holding up my hand for the entire trip, nor swinging the visor back and forth as the road curves. I would buy these again in a heartbeat. Plus I saved money over buying from Oakley directly! Woo hoo.\", 354: \"I'm very pleased with the quality of these glasses, definitely the real thing, this is the second pair I buy (first pair I bought at the mall) and they're identical to eachother, price is great and packaging is great as well.The only issue that I had was with the seller EzContactsUSA who took a while to ship my order, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the glasses (I will review the seller later)Bottom line is, if you're looking for a great price and you're willing to wait a few weeks to receive the glasses, you should buy them here!\", 355: 'Oakley sunglasses are the best! The Gascan with polarized lenses are great for all activities. They are well constructed and should last for a very long time.', 356: \"$70 online vs. $150 at my local sports shop. I wouldn't pay full price for these, but for $70, I'm very happy. Sharp looking frames, and the lenses are great.\", 357: \"The brand is great and so the model. Even though it only had one size it fits my head perfectly. The only downside I guess is when I put on top of my head it does not stay there very stable, it could fall down if you aren't careful with your head movements. However, maybe it was because the circumference of my head is not that big.\", 358: 'I have always worn Oakleys but never with the polarized lens. I am very happy with the sunglasses. These are my absolute favorite pair that I have owned. Definitely recommend!', 359: 'I had Gas Cans before, but left them at a bus stop. I will hang on to these! They are great for road cycling!', 360: \"I got the Urban Camoflouge version of these with grey lenses. I have owned plenty of sunglasses. Some are too expensive and they get lost. These are priced perfectly. I got my money worth. Some aren't high quality enough and they get damaged. These glasses are versatile. Some aren't fashionable enough. These glasses go with anything.

My original pair was custom-made through Oakley, and with all the simplest options, excluding polarized lenses, they were $220 retail.  So when I found them here on Amazon for as cheap as they are, I was too excited to not click and buy immediately!  Don't listen to the negative reviews unless the price is over your budget outright.The Oakley Gascan is a perfect fit for people with massive heads, not just for fit, but for the aesthetic.  I hated buying $50 piece-of-crap sunglasses that barely fit, and made the rest of my head look gigantic by comparison.  I highly recommend these sunglasses to everyone who asks.\", 364: 'I really like these sunglasses have a perfect design, are very comfortable thanks for the opportunity, really recommend with confidence!', 365: \"i lost my first pair after traveling for 20 something hours and was pretty bummed. so i got a new pair, they're not as loud as the other glasses i wear.\", 366: \"These shades are dope, but you knew that.

Although Bolle does indeed make very high quality sunglasses, I was just mesmerized by the style and look of these Oakley GasCans. They arrived last week and they look even better now than the picture. I have gotten multiple compliments even from strangers asking me where i got them. Very good on the eyes as the plutonite is as described. I do prefer polarized just because it filters out reflections from light and sun off glass and any reflective material. But for now these GasCan's by far suit the purpose\", 377: 'They fit and feel exactly how you would expect.  They let a little more light in than the all black frames, but if you know this ahead of time, and are ok with it, then you will be happy with them.

The frames are light, the lenses are shaded just right, not too dark or too light.  The amount of tint and polarization is important to me, as I have light hazel eyes, and the sun has always been an issue for me.  I've been wearing polarized sunglasses for 40 years, as I can hardly open my eyes when the sun is out.  Since I'm in Southern California, that's just about everyday.  The shape fits me perfectly.  A lot of sunglasses with thick frames are not comfortable for me, as they do not flex at all.  The GasCan model is very comfortable for me, and I can wear them all day without the sides of my head being sore from where the temple tips usually dig in behind the ears.  So, for that matter, the temple length is just right as well.  For what it's worth, I wear a 7 3/8 - 7 1/2, or L/XL fitted baseball cap.  I hope these sunglasses last me a long time.\", 388: \"Fantastic product for the price.  I personally think these are tacky....but great for a father's day gift!

Thanks you.\", 398: \"I have a few pairs of decent sunglasses, but I wanted a really nice pair for work/pleasure. I first saw these on the movie End of Watch (Jake Gyllenhaal's character wears them) and looked them up online. They got great reviews so I purchased the matte black frame with polarized lenses. They look awesome and feel even better. They feel much more sturdy than any other pair I have, and they are nice and light. They are pretty expensive, but worth it so far.\", 399: 'I like the wrap around style because it helps to keep them on my face. The width also provides good coverage for my eyes.', 400: 'I love these glasses, especially the polarization feature.

I will be getting another pair of the Gascans!\", 403: \"I've never thought Oakley's were worth the price, this is my first pair.  I bought them because I liked the color and the style.  I must say they are the most comfortable pair of sunglasses I have ever tried on.  I have a wide face and they fit perfectly, it says in the description they are for medium to large faces and that is right on.  They are light yet seem extremely durable.  I have heard of people paying $125 for Oakley's and I would never pay that, but $75 isn't that bad.  A good buy\", 404: \"I was a bit surprised at the feel of these sunglasses - I had expected heavier plastic like my previous Oakleys. However, I like the lightweight aspect of these, and I've had no issues with durability. As others have said, the hinges can be squeaky. Mine squeaked quite loudly when I first started using them, but they seem to have broken in a bit and don't squeak anymore.

Absolutely missed them for six months wasting money on cheap gas station glasses. Finally spent the money and got them never going back.', 413: 'Awesome sunglasses, I love that you can wear them all day and even until almost dark.  The only down fall of the glasses is that they seem to slide down my nose.  You might want to try them on at a store before buying. I got them at a awesome price.', 414: \"When i got my sunglasses i can't believe it how fast this product and good prices was neta que esta chingon lol...\", 415: \"Once I found these Oakleys I knew they were mine. For one reason is the price you can't beat that. The one thing that scared me was finding that anyone with a wide head best look for a different type of Oakleys, and that they slide down your face quite often. Well you better think again, if you have a wide shaped head you are fine they will truly fit and will never slide down your face.

Only downside is apparently I have a greasy head that really shows on the flat black frame when I take them off, not oakley's fault.

I was solidly in the &#34;why would I spend money on sunglasses when I'll just lose them&#34; camp before I pulled the trigger on these. I've had a few scares but I can proudly say they're still in my possession. The best thing about these is the lens quality. Blocks out glare so much better than anything I've tried before.Two complaints would be that when worn all day, they make the tops of my ears sore. Could just be my head though. Another is that the lenses seem to get small scratches on them pretty easily.\", 426: \"There great shades they come on time and fit nice. The price was right as we'll. five stars for the shads\", 427: 'Overall these glasses are great. I work 12hrs shifts with the sun hitting me all day long, so eyeprotection is important.

Also, they make me look totally radical.\", 450: \"I see a lot of people lately with these larger styled Oakleys probably because they fit bigger melons like my own.

I had high expectations for them given the price, and aside from a few annoyances, they lived up to them. the pros of these glasses are mostly aesthetic--cool icon, nice, modern shape. I'm am a little displeased with a few features:1. they're not as dark as I had hoped-- not dark enough for poker. You can still see the eyes faintly.2. They creak when you open them. I find this to be a bit annoying.3. They fingerprint very easily. I touch the sides with my fingers and can see the finger print left rather clearly, though noone standing at a reasonable distance would notice.4. They don't sit terribly well on the ears-- I feel like they should fall off when I wear them , but thanks to my big head there's no danger of them falling off. Maybe the feel of them is just something that takes getting used to.\", 483: \"I have recently fell off the bandwagon of the cheap Electric glasses.

The only reason I'm replacing them now is that I lost them. Go for the bronze colored lens, they have the added bonus of enhancing contrast on cloudy/rainy days.

My 14 month old twins constantly play with them, they have not been able to break a pair yet. The only reason I've have to buy 6 was because one I drove over with a truck (can't expect em to survive that) and lost 2 over the years, and now I have 3 different color frames, lenses and one of them with polarized lenses. Just a warning to those thinking about polarization. Oakley has great pole lenses, which is awesome, but sucks when trying to read anything digital.

Oakleys are not cheap, by any means.  They have a variety of glasses that serve different purposes and have different fits and lens shades.  I have the polarized Straight Jackets and they fit me great.  The Gascans, IMO, are more for a \"fashion statement\" as they had somewhat of a loose fit.  They would not be well-suited for sports but would probably be great for driving or hanging around the pool.  I use my Straight Jacket\\'s for bike riding, driving, shooting, etc and they are an all-around great fitting pair of glasses with rubberized frame \"sleeves\" that help keep your glasses in place.  Do your homework before spending $150+ for glasses!', 523: 'Oakley quality at a great price.  These sunglassesook great and were a fraction of the price found at other retailers.', 524: 'Product is great ! So happy I made this purchase. Worth the money! They are REAL Oakleys! Love them ! Come brand new and not a scratch on mine. Get compliments all the time. Very great product!', 525: 'i got these Oakley sunglasses very fast.  they were exactly as described, and i believe i got a great deal on the price.  thanks.', 526: \"Oakley sunglasses are great quality however I got  a pair of Parkman sunglasses from one line and it's about the same price and they are all natural wood with a amazing polarized lens for the beach.\", 527: 'You are gonna get what you ordered. I am very pleased with the product and service. I received the item sooner than expected, which totally made my day.

Happy with my results. I will enjoy wearing them with confidant I got a great product', 531: \"Lens seem to scratch easy but I bought these for work and have been using them a long time.  They don't break easy.  I have sat on them and the sides popped off but went back together easy.  Most sunglasses are done when you sit on them.  These are still on my face today.  Good buy\", 532: \"The clarity is excellent and they are a nice light weight.  The problem is they are called one size fits all and they slide down my nose.  I live in the desert so I stay away from glasses with rubber nose parts because they degrade quickly in the heat.  These seemed good in the store so I ordered them.  I am not sure if I will return them but it is tempting.  I just don't know what will be better.\", 533: \"I wanted Oakleys before but did not want to pay the price. These are for a large faced person and fit me great and a good price. Wish had ordered two. Love them I am pleased. Thank's\", 534: 'Solid, quality product.

I am pleased withthis pair of sun glasses.  I like the crystal black frame. I would recommend these glasses!', 536: \"my best pair of Oakley's yet. I've had multiple sunglasses from Oakley and these are by far the best model i've had. Not too big, not too small... and of course quality lenses. I eventually had to buy a new set of lenses and did so due to my appreciation for this frame model. Highly recommend\", 537: 'I was worried when I bought these that they may be to bulky or heavy on my nose, but after getting them yesterday and warring them for a better part of the day, I forgot I even had them on. They look great, fit great, and were a great buy.', 538: \"These are one of the only glasses that properly fit my face. Most glasses leave a gap at the temple area just lateral to my eyes where my face starts to curve back but the glasses keep going out. This looks bad and makes the glasses look oversized. The GasCans are closer to my face, eliminating gaps while looking and feeling good on my face.I like the matte finish on these, I also had a pair of glossy black finish which was great as well, but I prefer the matte look.Replaceable lenses are very nice, I use these as shooting safety glasses as well so I often have clear lenses in them. The lenses are fairly easy to change, you just pop them out of the front of the frame while pulling the edges apart. Don't worry, the lenses wont break. Check out all the different lenses available on amazon. My first lenses got scratched while I was at the beach. This was still pretty disappointing because the polarized lenses are very expensive, but its a better option then paying for a whole new pair. Also gives you the option of wearing cheaper lenses if you're going to the beach and don't want the sand scratching your lens.All in all, these are some of the only glasses that fit me properly so 5/5:+ great fit+ matte black look+ polarized lenses+ replaceable lensesand if I had to be picky, I'd say the &#34;arms&#34; or temples as they are called, are a bit too thick and I'd prefer a thinner line at the ears\", 539: 'Great pair of Oakley shades. The polarized lenses make all the difference in the world when it comes to eye protection. Possibly the best sunglasses i have ever owned.', 540: 'I bought these glasses because i was looking for a new pair for work. They have gotten dropped a couple of times and never had any damage to them.', 541: 'Excellent glasses.  I took them with me to the beach.  The sun was shinning and hot.  While sailing, I could not see anything without my new glasses.  The iridium polarized glasses really work fine.', 542: 'I have three pair of Oakley\\'s all different and there is nothing, absolutely nothing like Oakley\\'s!

I realized something was missing and the badass look I was going for wasn't quite badass enough. Well hide yo wives now, because now I'm 100% intimidating handsomeness. I look tough like Mr Clean and pretty like Jake Gyllnhaal in End of Watch (Jake wears the Gascans in that flick, see how they look while shooting gangsters). I work in Law Enforcement and criminals pay attention now because my glasses clearly state that I'm not afraid to jam you up and whup your ass. They are comfy and the lens is polarized which helps me see criminal scum better. Also the lenses are dark enough to scope out chicks undetected. Highly recommended to LEO and wannabes.\", 544: \"These are comfortable and fit well.I'm very happy with them. I use them for driving and sports.

I have a pretty average sized face and head, helmet size Medium, hat size 7 1/4.These are the Oakleys of this era - everybody and their sister has a pair of gascans.  First, that means you can't go wrong with them.  The style is cool, they fit nearly everyone, and everyone likes them.  They're typical Oakley quality: clear lenses and durable frames.  Believe me, I've tested that durability and they can take a beating.  Lots of beatings.  I still wear these most of the time, they just feel good and look good.  It's like a broken in shoe.  Everybody should have a pair of gascans of their face.\", 548: \"Great fit and looks.!! Only style of sunglasses I'll ever buy. Very clear and fit well to my face.

They fit him perfectly and he loves them.\", 552: \"I usual don't write product reviews but I feel like I have to after an incident today.  Okay first off, I always assumed my oakleys were overpriced b/c who wants to spend this money on sunglasses unless your one of &#34;those guys&#34; that collects them.  I've had them for about 9 months now and they've been pretty good.  For some reason they were on the floor while I was frantic trying to get out the door and just destroyed them.  I don't mean i just lightly stepped I mean if there was a small animal under my feet it wouldve been roadkill.  Think 205 lb bull in china shop.  immediately I started freaking out because I saw 5 pieces on the floor.  Then I looked closer and realized nothing was broken--I just snapped the pieces back together like a puzzle (the two sides the front then the two lenses).  I just stood there in aw for about 30 seconds when I realized what just happened and that they still moved and fit exactly the same on my face.\", 553: 'I love these they are very comfortable.  I use these for work.  they are durrable they dont scratch easy I got them in two colors I want more', 554: \"I have wanted a pair of Oakeys for years, but I've always found the prices to be more than I would consider paying for a pair of sunglasses. The GasCan model has always appealed to me, and when I saw Amazon's price (about half the price of brick and mortar), I pulled the trigger. I am glad I did! These glasses exude quality in terms of fit and optic clarity. They are comfortable, and the distortions that are common in lesser quality lenses are absent. I elected to buy this pair without the Oakley iridium lenses because I was looking for &#34;ultrablack&#34;. These lenses are not reflective at all, and when worn, strike a sleek, non-seethrough profile. If desired, you can buy a range of lenses in different colors; changing lenses is very easy and there are no issues with fit. Think undercover action hero. Great glasses, very solid. Highly recommended.\", 555: \"Love them.  I have the Fuel Cell version of these glasses.  These glasses are lighter and a little smaller.  Fit great!  They look good and I'm looking forward to a sunny day so I can wear them out.\", 556: 'For a hundred bucks I was very happy to get them. Oakleys have always been overly expensive but to get quality lenses you have to pay the piper. I am happy to get this quality of Oakley Gascan model and with a second endorcer \"Ducati\" on the lense, makes them a little cooler. Very cool and I feel like I got a good deal. Packaging was great and shipping quick. ALSO this product arrived exactly as shown. Heck, I paid 100 bucks for a pair of Oakley Frogskins in 1989 these are much cooler.', 557: \"These glasses are nice. I had to return them for a reason that was not related to the product.They are light weight, comfortable, and the lenses were great.

They were priced right and I would recommend buying these.', 562: \"These glasses are just amazing. They do not look very dark but they definately work. They reduce glare and brightness but they are not too dark as to when you wear them going inside that you are momentarily blind. They look great on too. Oakley's GasCans are EXCELLENT!\", 563: 'I have been buying oakley sunglasses for about 6 years now.  This is the 3rd pair I have bought, and they continue to impress me.  These are by far the best pair I have bought for my active lifestyle.  They dont have any rubber gripping on them or any small crevices which generally make the lenses more difficult to keep clean.  These are excellent for someone who spends alot of time outdoors.  just make sure you dont have a big head, as they can pinch your head like they do mine due to the think plastic not being very flexible.', 564: \"Gascans are good sunglasses but not all-around ones.  They would not be good for sports, they don't have a snug enough fit.  I needed a decent pair that wouldn't bend or break all the time.  I spend a lot of time driving and getting in and out of the car, into meetings, etc all day and have busted up more than a few 'cheapies' in the process.As to some other reviews I would absolutely agree you should check these out in person first if you can.

These are a bit bigger then some of the \"jacket\" line and took some getting used to.  I do like how the lenses are a bit better protected.  For someone with a big head, the glasses don\\'t do a great job of sitting on my nose as much as hovering over it.  I wish they were slightly bigger, though after a few months I\\'ve just gotten used to their unique fit.I will say the polarized lens were worth the extra expense.  I\\'ve never owned a pair before that had this feature, and I will never go back.  Makes a huge difference with glare.', 567: 'Glasses came fast and were awesome.

Great field of view.The only problem i have with these it that its hard to wear them with a hat. A bit awkward. On some occasions they start to give me headaches and I need to take them off for a few minutes.And one last thing, they don't stay on your head if you push them up when going indoors. They slide off all the time so I have to put them in a pocket and risk smashing into something and maybe breaking them, or leave them in the car.\", 592: 'Looking for some alternatives to SPY and Under Armour I found these and thought I\\'d give Oakley a shot - I generally don\\'t like the brand as being too popular and widely worn - not much different than buying a Camry or Accord \"everyone\\'s got one\" but as these fairly inexpensive I put them in my cart.  Couple days later (thanks Amazon Prime) they arrived in perfect condition - no damage to the outer box and the packing inside was adequate and protected the sunglasses from damage.  The Oakley box wasn\\'t much to look at compared to even less expensive brands IMO Oakley could do a bit nice (and probably has in the past) job with it\\'s presentation.  Opening the box contains the glasses (duh!), the drawstring cover/lens cloth and more printed material than I received with my last  wireless tablet - basically it\\'s the warranty card and warranty description.On to the glasses - I probably have a bit larger head than most but \"pumpkin\" by no means - these fit tight in the temple area which is great for activities where some sunglasses may fly off your noggin - these probably won\\'t even though there\\'s no rubber along the ridge of the temples.  Speaking of temples these are fairly straight and thin so if you\\'re looking for a pair of glasses to go under a helmet (for motorcycling, etc) they may work well - I ride and that\\'s always a challenge to find sunglasses that don\\'t have too much curve or are too thick in the temples.  The lens area are adequate but you do catch a bit of the bottom rim in your view even when you\\'re not glancing down - after a bit you stop noticing but this might be annoying to some - most popular models of \"sport\" sunglasses are rimless at the bottom of the frames and don\\'t have this issue but this style you kind of know that going in.  The hinges seem to be of good quality - they don\\'t make noise or seem weak or flimsy.  If you typically rest your sunglasses around your neck with the backs of the temples holding them on the back of your neck you probably can\\'t with these for a couple of reasons - one there\\'s no rubber to keep them from slipping and two the temples are very straight.  You couldn\\'t put croakers or similar retention bands on them either since the temples are tapered and still pretty tall at their ends - they\\'re probably not a good choice if you have to take them on and off often without folding them and placing them in a shirt pocket, etc.  The optical quality is very good the level of tint is fine - not too dark or light - they don\\'t really have a gradient at the top of the lens which is fine - I personally find that a bit distracting as most windshields in cars have that too.The overall quality is good but Oakley could have rounded or finished the edges of the temples a bit more as they almost feel \"sharp\" - that\\'s where the \"cheap\" comes in - when you pick these up by the temples that\\'s your first impression - \"are these genuine Oakley\\'s?  I almost cut myself!\"  I may take some 800 grit sandpaper and take the edge off of the bottom of the temples this weekend.All-in-all if you get a good deal (I\\'d say under $65) and if you\\'re in the market for a new pair of \"Oaks\" I\\'d consider buying.', 593: 'This is a repeat pair for me.

Oh well great product', 601: 'I like Oakley glasses. I had the black GasCans and loved them, the white are the same. Nice size, great lenses a must have for the outside.', 602: 'Design:The sunglasses are sleek, and there are some minor contours in these that show how much craftsmanship goes into Oakley sunglasses. They are definitely durable, I would not be afraid of breaking these if I dropped them or semi-crushed them (though I still suggest a hardshell case if you are spending this kind of money on sunglasses).Lenses:The lenses in these are far superior to any cheaper alternatives. Oakley guarantees 100% UV protection. This particular model has polarized lenses, which I suggest if you do a lot of driving, water sports, or snow activities. The polarized lenses really save your eyes from glare. Go to YouTube if you are interested in seeing the visual differences between polarized and non-polarized lenses.Personal Experience:The second day I had these GasCan sunglasses, I smashed them into a wall... and I mean REALLY smashed them. They were in my pocket and I moved out of the way for a waitress, so they squeezed between the wall and my leg. One of the lenses slightly popped out of the frame, but it very easily popped right back into place. They squeak loudly when I open or close them now, but are otherwise in perfect condition. The point of that story was to express the durability of these things. I squished them hard, and there is no visible damage whatsoever. My cheaper sunglasses would have been in several pieces after that incident.If you really care about protecting your eyes and you want sunglasses that will last a long time, I highly recommend these.UPDATE 4/18/12:The squeaking sound when opening the sunglasses is not a result of the incident described above. Apparently all Oakley GasCan sunglasses (and some other styles) squeak when they are new. I have spoken to other Oakley owners who say you have to wear them in.', 603: \"Hubby loves these glasses.

When I opened the package I was very pleased the original box was unopened when it arrived and the glasses inside we're beautiful. The only problem I had was that the glasses started squeaking very loud when the hinges moved but this resolved its self after I took off the sides and put them back on.

However, they sit a little high on his nose and this creates a gap at the bottom of the lens that he is disappointed about.', 623: \"These are the expected quality from Oakelys, great! Which is why I only buy sunglasses for my bf from them. The quality is always outstanding and the make is so durable. I would recommend these for anyone with an active lifestyle so you don't have to worry about them falling apart the second time you wear them! Great product!\", 624: 'these are the best sunglasses i have ever bought, just love the way they got delivered too.  Am taking good care them i hope i can get at least a year out them before the lenses get to scratched.', 625: \"They're just a little tight around the sides.

I'm really proud to own one ;) they're the best ever glasses by Oakely...fit my face as if made for my face...the color of the glass is awsome...the only issue i had in the beginning was sweating near my eyes area, due to the structure of this glasses..but its OK  now, m used to it....and it was summers when i bought it =P therez no more sweat now, and there are no other issues of any type...i strongly recommend if you are looking forward to invest money in a good pair of glasses =)..and yes, do visit a store near by to check the size, if it fits your face =)\", 631: 'My Gascans arrived a couple of days ago. They looked even better in person than the pictures on amazon. I was very pleased when took them out the box. They came earlier than the vendor stated, would definately buy from this seller again. Perfect fit, very comfortable, and good coverage of sun blocking. I love the tint on the lense,they really brighten everything,and are great for cutting down on glare and contrast. The bronze is not to dark either. These are large and have somewhat bling styling, maynot be for everyone. One of the reviews I read earlier said that they didnt fit,but he stated that he was an average size guy. Well Oakley states that they are made for large melons. They make a Gascan small,that are styled a little diferently,and fit a little tighter. I would suggest to anyone to go to the mall and try on a pair before ordering. Sunglasses are like shoes,they all fit differently.', 632: 'The Oakley GasCan Sunglasses with Black Iridium Lens and Crystal Black Frame was everything I wanted and more. They fit perfectly and the lens gives full vision without any distorsicn. They are the best quality sunglasses I have ever owned including perscription glasses. These weigh less and are more clear. The frame is very light and after a time you forget you have them on. I expected Oakley to produce a quality product but I got more than I had ever hoped for. Love them and the compliments I get wearing them.', 633: 'These are great glasses. They are very high quality and they are eligable for Amazon Prime, to they arrive on your doorstep super fast. The only thing that i dislike about them is that the sometimes slide off of your head when you are not wearing them over your eyes. Other than that, I would highly recommend these glasses.', 634: \"Excellent shades for driving and physical activities. Too bad they squeak when you open them, why would Oakley let such a defect fly? Maybe there is something I can do about the noise so I'll look into it and update. Either way I'm happy with them, would purchase again.\", 635: 'This is the second purchase of these succeeded Gascan glasses.But because it brings washcloth to clean the lenses.And I have confirmed that if they come and contramarcados.Thank me clarify my concern.William Marin.', 636: 'These Oakleys look very sleek and nice.  I had upgraded from my Oakley Spikes.  The only problem is that they tend to keep sliding down my nose whenever I sweat or have lotion on my face.  I find myself constantly having to push the glasses back up my nose during the hot summer weathers.  I think this may depend on the structure of your face.', 637: \"I never dreamed of paying $150 just for sunglasses but after I got them I was completely satisfied. I love them! They are the most amazing sunglasses I've ever had. Shipping was fast even with standard shipping. Although I did buy them for $150 and a few days after they shipped, the price dropped almost $10. Other than that, I would recommend them to anyone and everyone!\", 638: \"I've very satistafed with this product. Stylish & Affordable if you purchase on amazon - half the price in an expenive mall store.Pros:-Very good in the direct sunlight. The Iridium Polarized lenses are just great.

They are not deffective its just the way the hing is shaped. I've owned 3 pairs, 2 of them did creak, 1 did.

However, patience, persistence, a lot of elbow grease, cursing and more patience as well as referring to a YouTube video of how to do this, and I was successful. I expect to get another 5 years+ use from this set of lenses and bought a new Oakley sunglass bag to protect them and make sure I do.Given that the replacement lenses were about a third the cost of a new pair of sunglasses, buying these lenses makes a lot of sense!', 648: 'The lenses were just as promised.

I wanted something to match my San Francisco Giants orange attire so I purchased these Fire Iridium lenses.  To me, the look was a reflective yellow/orange which satisfies me.  I can wear these new lenses on my sunglasses and look like I'm on of the playas on the field.  It reduces glare and great for driving.  It was difficult to insert these lenses, but after firmly sliding them into position, it looks great.\", 661: \"I have owned my Oakley Half Jacket for several years and was thrilled when I could just order replacement lenses instead of paying more than double to replace the glasses (my old lenses are really scratched).

Just watch this first and you'll save yourself some time!  [...].\", 662: \"I bought knock off replacement lenses for my Oakley glasses about a year ago, they were lighter, scratched easier and did not block as much light as the real Oakley lenses.  Bottom line you get what you pay for, these are easy to install and feel more substantial than the knock off's.  Hopefully they won't scratch as easily and will last, I don't mind paying a little extra for better quality and so far these are great.\", 663: 'The lenses were a bit difficult to install but you just need to seat them as far as you can into the outside hook before trying to slip in the inside hook.  You can push pretty hard without worrying about breaking them and the quality is great as expected from Oakley.

I contacted Amazon and received a quick replacement set of lenses. The lenses are good quality and fit the Half Jacket frames well (though I have learned over the years to file the sharp nibs a bit in order to make assembly easier).', 668: \"This is a terrific replacement lense. They provide very clear vision in a variety of sun conditions. It's never to dark or to light. One note......the bright gold mirror look in the picture is not a true representation of the actual color. The actual color has more of a brown/gold look to it and has less mirror effect. Regardless, they still look cool, and the vision quality is ideal for all conditions.\", 669: \"I have a son in Afghanistan - says these Oakley's are the best and worth the cost.  They are great!\", 670: \"There is a difference in the size of the new Half Jacket 2.0 and the old, these will only work on the old Half Jacket frames.I called Oakley support, and as the Half Jacket 2.0 has just been released, accessory lenses are not available and will not be for a few months.  I ended up returning this item (Amazon return was flawless).I ended up returning my HJ 2.0 glasses and buying the Flak Jacket with these lenses.  The 4 rating is for the g30 lenses in those frames.  I wore them for 3 rounds this weekend, in bright sun, light clouds, and even heavy clouds while a storm moved in.  Even in very bright conditions, I did not feel eye strain, which I normally do as I have a light sensitivity.  I could track the ball in flight equal to not wearing glasses at all, but I would not say they made it any easier to see it.  To me, that was a vast improvement over every other lens I have tried, as most times wearing sunglasses meant not being able to see the ball for more than 150-200 yards.On the down side, you are definitely looking at the world through rose colored glasses.  The ball had a pink tint that was odd getting used to, but after awhile I got used to it and didn't notice.  It's also very light, so you can see your eyes, not the lens for those that prefer the intimidating look.\", 671: 'I bought them to replace the old lenses,  they are a great product. Love my oakley lenses have 3 models the best.', 672: \"I bought these replacement lenses to replace the ones in my glasses because I had dropped the glasses in the gravel driveway and the original lenses had been seriously scuffed. I may have stepped on them without knowing I had dropped the glasses. Anyhow, when one has an expensive pair of glasses and they become useless, we try to repair them! At least that's my philosophy. So I purchased these lenses a year ago and have been using the glasses for playing golf (my original purpose for buying them) ever since.  Though my golf game is no better, I'm 99% sure it's not the lenses that are at fault!\", 673: \"I have used and loved these G-30 lenses on several pairs Half Jackets since Oakley first came out with them. They can be very difficult to install but are usually easy to remove. Don't try it without following the instructions! I have always used a microfiber cloth to clean them (not just the Oakley supplied lens bag) and have never had a problem. Also, these were expensive since I have paid in the $40-$45 range for the same lens in the past.\", 674: \"The lens are high quality, but you must use the lens bag to clean the lens. The lens bag is a special cloth. With my previous lens, I cleaned the with a non-Oakley cloth. My use of a non-Oakley cloth scratched the lens! Please follow Oakley's instructions and use their cloth.\", 675: \"I bought these oakley glasses one time in 2005 here in Mexico, then my wife simply brought them to a friend who didn't return them me again, after that I missed them to much, the thing was here in my Place never were continuing this model in stock, and when I saw them again on internet, I can stop to wish them again.\", 676: \"I just bought a second pair of limited edition Frogskins by Oakley, and since the last pair got a little scratched up I decided to invest in a case for these. This case definitely does the job. It fits the Frogskins with plenty of room, but not so much room that it's a danger to the glasses. I love the way the case stays open and upright so that you can put your glasses on display!\", 677: \"It fits very tightly. I thought I can't put the Gunglasses into the case, but it fits really tight.But no bending or something, you can use it without any damage to the Sunglass ;)And details are the same as the picture, but the intaglio logo printed on it shows a little dark color compare with the background.So it's not so shiny looking than I expected.Inside matarials are really good. it looks shiny white.The last thing I want to mention is the hinge.Very narrow still colored hinge you can see from the outside. It makes the case looks not perfect anyway.\", 678: 'I purchased this case because the Urgency sunglasses came with a flexible zipper case.  The case works nicely and snaps closed tight.  It definitely will protect your investment.  The only downfall is that it very oversized if you are putting in a purse etc. that is on the smaller side.  Overall great buy.', 679: 'My wife bought a pair of new frogskins just before Christmas and was having a ahrd time finding a case that they would fit in.  This case fits the glasses perfectly.', 680: 'This has taken 2 months of hard use from a woman who can break about anything. Sunglasses have survived very well. The case has been banged up a bit, but still functions...', 681: \"This is a great case and it fits my enormous Maui Jims when no other case in the store does. It snaps shut firmly and stays closed.The only thing to note is that the hinge wears out after about a year and the case won't stay closed any more. I've had to replace this case about once a year since I bought my first one three years ago.Still, it's a great price and a great product.\", 682: 'I bought a pair of glasses at the Oakley outlet store and they did not have a hard cover. This cover is hard and effective enough to protect them.', 683: 'These are just what i was looking for when my old lenses got scratched.

I bought them so I'd only need one pair of frames and exchange the lenses.\", 685: \"I got these to replace my husband's lenses that were pitted out and scratched.  These fit the glasses perfectly and look really good.  I'm very happy with the purchase.\", 686: 'Exactly what I was looking for!

Highly recommend prouduct as described.', 688: 'The yellow lense is great for overcast and cloudy days.  The M-Frame lenses are very easy to put in or take out.  It makes switching between different tinted lenses for varying light conditions simple.  Thumbs up for this approach to sporting sunglasses.  I would definately recomend the Oakley lenses and the Oakely M-Frames to friends or family.', 689: \"ive tried many different sun glasses but these take the cake for me the M FRAME Heaters are by far the coolest glasses [ doesn't go with everyone ] but i ve gotten many compliments with these in the public not a lot of people know about Oakley but i use these for everyday wear i ve got about 5 different replacement lenses !\", 690: 'Nice oem lens they fit great took about 30 seconds to install and they even arrived before the expect date', 691: 'After I bought these product I have my doughts, but the time tell me I was wrong and I still use it for softball and other sports.', 692: 'I make an average of 80 miles a week in my bike and my rollerblades in Mexico City, against every possible hazardous element you can imagine, from cars and holes to dust particles and UV overexposure.

Compared to other brands, Oakley's lens material is more scratch resistant, impact resistant, and has perfect optical clarity.  Plus a useful variety of lens tints and vents.  Finally lens fit and finish is superb.\", 696: \"I can see clearly now the rain is gone...I can see all obstacles in my way!! It's gonna be abright sun shiny day!\", 697: 'Was very skeptical about buying lens online. I ordered a set of M frames for using at gun range. The set I have came with clear and black lens. I wanted a set of yellow for indoor range shooting. Could not find anything for the exact M frames that I have. I tried these knowing that amazon has good return policy and they fit perfect. They work great for indoor use as well. They are also great for low light gun shooting. Nose piece came with lens which is a plus. Will definitely look here again for replacement lens.', 698: \"The lens fit perfectly into the frame. It took a bit of wiggling and pushing in, but it's snug and secure. The lens is pink..don't try to justify the color saying it's iridium. The width of the lens is shorter than I hoped for. Overall, the lens helps brighten and clear the golf course, and at the same time prevent sunlight from ruining my sight. Great product.\", 699: 'This is the most stylish sunglass I ever bought.Everyone complements it.Only thing is the store I bought is from outside of US,so custom charged me like $70...', 700: \"I have had these lenses in my frames before.

I'll update this review during the summer.\", 702: 'Anyone purchasing lenses for the Half Jacket frame needs to be aware of what version they have.  The older version works with Half Jacket and Half Jacket XLJ lenses.  The newer version works Half Jacket 2.0 and Half Jacket 2.0 XL lenses.  At a glance, the XLJ lens shape and size do appear to be the same as the newer 2.0 XL, but the former are actually too small to fit the 2.0 frame.', 703: 'Having recently moved to AZ I found that really good sunglasses are essential especially for cycling. I have had my Half Jacket XLJ frames for some time, and these lens were the perfect upgrade to deal with the Sonoran Desert sun on the bike and off. Polarized lenses really make a difference and the contrast is amazing. Well worth the rather steep price.', 704: 'Make sure you read the instructions on installing the new lens, because it is made to be a tight fit.  Once the lens snapped in, it was a perfect fit for my Oakley Sports.', 705: 'I was told by an Oakley employee these were the favorite of many people and now I know why.

What more can you ask for???', 707: \"I ordered these lenses and after I got them I realized I ordered the wrong style.  I needed Flak Jacket lenses.  I tried everything to return these lenses.  I got zero response from the Backcountry store.  I just wanted to exchange for the right lenses that were the same price.It has been about a year and I still haven't heard anything from Backcountry.  I did file a complaint with Amazon AtoZ warranty.  Amazon did refund my money and I got the right lenses.Either way Oakley makes great lenses and glasses.\", 708: 'These lenses work great. The gold hue they have really helps when shooting, or when wearing them during times when there is not incredibly bright sunlight. I found that they were not quite dark enough for the days when the sun is out in full force, so I opted to buy the blue ice polarized lenses for those days, and they work perfectly.', 709: 'When the 1st set delivered the product box was crushed and the lenses scratched. The lenses came with another pair which was alright. Amazon made good the order and send a replacement with great efficiency. Will definitely order when I need to.', 710: \"LOVE this lens color!

Only issue, and this may be related to all Oakley replacements as far as I know, the lenses were VERY hard to install.

Not really meant to be carried in a pocket, that's what the cleaning bag is for. This is more designed to be thrown in a glove box or backpack.\", 722: 'Awesome case.  Holds the glasses and extra lenses!  The case is very sturdy and I feel confident my glasses are being protected.', 723: 'Purchased to replace case (with two sets of lenses) that was stolen from me at Whispering Straits.

He loves it, thinks it's very 'tactical' because it holds two extra pair of lenses plus the lenses on the glasses. Everything is well protected; there is high density foam on the bottom to hold everything in place and then lighter foam on top to cushion. We haven't experienced scratches as the other reviewer noted. Perhaps if there is dirt on the lenses then putting them away in the foam might cause scratching. The case is a bit bulky for everyday use, and he uses a smaller case which fits into his laptop bag. But for storing lenses and glasses and keeping everything clean and safe, it is perfect!\", 725: 'Purchased this Oakley Ha;f/Flak Jacket soft vault sunglass storage case.

What more is there to say - it is the best!', 739: 'I was surprised at how large this case is. If you are looking for a case that will fit in your pocket, this is NOT the case you want. If you want a sturdy case that will protect your expensive Half Jackets while traveling in a suitcase, car, or golf bag...this IS the case you want. The case comes with slots in the foam so your Half Jacket just slides in. Zip it shut, and you rest easy knowing the case will protect your Half Jackets from pretty much anything except fire or getting run over by a steam roller.', 740: 'This case is exactly like the original.  Best not to lose or damage the original, but this one is a perfect replacement.', 741: 'We bought this as the case for the sunglasses we bought. however our sunglass came with a case so this is a lovely extra. Nice case.', 742: 'Protects my oakleys very well.  Fits in snug and prevents them from any movement inside.  Highly recommend!  Recommend adding a clip that allows the case to be easily attached to a golf bag.', 743: \"It's great to protect your shades the only downside is that it is a little bulky, but otherwise great.\", 744: \"I bought this from a local store as I needed some descent protection for my newly purchased Half Wire 2.0, this case delivers the protection nicely.Only downside is as the other poster commented is how bulky it is, I would like to have seen a belt loop or provisions to attach a clip of some sort.Will be purchasing another case soon for my Half X's\", 745: 'This case is fantastic. Sturdy and very well padded to held the glasses securely and prevent scratching. I was worried at first about the zip closure rather than a spring, but the zip is oversize and strong, keeping dust and dirt out very well.', 746: 'I am pleased with the Oakley glasses case except that is a little bulky to carry.I would recommend product based on the protection feature of the hard case.', 747: 'This is the third time I got one of this. I love this model, durability is one of his best features.', 748: 'These came quick and exactly as advertised. I retrofitted these to replace privious Oakley lenses that I had for my loupes at work. Solidly made and comfortable.', 749: 'I have a pair of these and I purchased them because of the Trasitions lens.  I am a huge Oakley collector and wanted a pair that I could wear at work for safety glasses and also outside.  The glasses themselves are the standard Oakley, nice construction, excellent fit.  But my main beef is with the Transition lenses.  The are still to dark to wear inside.  You can see through them pretty good, but they a little dark, dark enough for people to wonder why you are wearing sunglasses inside, I know this because a few people asked me, lol.  I thought they would be like my regular glasses I used to wear that were clear as a bell indoors and dark out doors.  These are kind of dark indoors, and kind of darker outdoors, like the other reviewer said, you can hardly notice the difference in the shade, you almost question weather they do change or not.  These glasses are nice, but they dont get light enough for a 5 star.  Maybe I should have checked some out before I ordered them online.', 750: 'I saw a young lad wearing these with extremely strong thick lenses. When i questioned him about his glasses he replied that he took these and removed the sunglass lenses and had his own strong thick eyeglass lenses made up and fitted in the frames. He looked great in them so i did likewise! I`m not sure if anyone else has done this but i am very happy with my results with them!  My glasses however are not as strong or my lenses nearly as thick as the young lads so , i believe look a bit more appealing.', 751: \"This sunglasses are just great, the shape is great and you can't even feel them since the weight is almost zero\", 752: \"Bought these for baseball and have loved them. Also really nice when out driving when the sun is setting. I think it's a little tight on the side's as in squeezing my head a little bit but I can  make them comfy usually. Good glasses.. What do you expect, they are Oakley's.\", 753: 'Great quality lens, better than iridium persimmon, much more clear and easier to view in cloudy condition.  Seller met all expectations.', 754: 'This is a great lens and easy to install.  It is a nice way to update a favorite frame without having to purchase a whole new goggle..', 755: \"This snapped right in on my A frame goggles. I haven't had them in the snow yet but they fit great.\", 756: 'The perfect complement for foggy days in the mountains when you skiing. Fits in the frame perfect and very fast.', 757: 'These lenses are great. Very easy to swap out. Fits the discription perfectly. Very pleased with them and they worked great.', 758: 'This lens works perfectly and made my old pair of A-Frames like new!  No more fogging even in the worst conditions!', 759: 'These are perfect lenses for sunny conditions. Nice a dark and they look good! They snapped straight in to the A Frames without any issues.', 760: 'These Oakley A frame replacement lenses popped in very easily to the existing goggles.  They look fabulous and when the sun is shining off the slopes, they cut the glare perfectly. I would definitely recommend these replacement lenses to anyone who is looking for them!  Again, easy to use, and looks great!', 761: \"I have worn Oakley sunglasses for almost 25 years and for several good reasons.  Quality, style, performance, value, safety... the list goes on.  These fit my existing frames perfect (as they should).  They are great in bright sunlight but also worked well enough through the clouds in Whistler as they are not to bright.  Most importantly, no one can see my eyes behind this lens!  :)I only got the chance to use these 3-4 days this past winter, but as long as I treat them right and don't faceplant on them, they will give me years of service.  Just make sure they are cleaned properly (just the Oakley bag) and they will give many years of service.\", 762: 'Good product. Replacing scratched lens is a no brainer compared to buying entire new goggles. a  $100.00+ savings.Perfect for flat light/hazy conditions.', 763: \"I would recommend the Blue Iridium lens for any lighting condition. I bought this lens to replace a Pink Iridium lens that i had scratched the inside of. At first, I was going to purchase a straight up replacement but decided to do a little more research, since I wasn't always pleased with the contrast that the Pink Iridium lenses offered. Although it let more light in, it didn't always offer enough contrast in overcast conditions. While doing research on Oakley's website and using their lens/lighting simulator, I came across the Blue Iridium lens. At first I was a bit skeptical because on paper, it actually let less light through, which I thought would make it harder to see in overcast conditions, but let me tell you, something about how this lens filters out blue light does wonders for creating contrast in low light conditions. It works great in sunny conditions as well. I considered buying another lens for sunny conditions before receiving this lens, however, this will be my primary and only lens.\", 764: 'Over all this is a great watch.  Very different looking with lots of details and dare I say a sexy beast yet unique.  THE WATCH GETS A 4.5 The only problem I have is with Oakley themselves. I GIVE THEM A 3.  Some of their stuff is waaaaay overpriced and not really worth the money. As well some of their policies are bogus.As an example on this watch, if you want to change the strap to what they call the Unobtainum (rubber) @ $90! You cant go to an oakley store and get it, you can\\'t go online and have them and have them send it to you, you can\\'t buy from a watch dealer (there are no certified oakley watch dealers) you have to call oakley, get a number and send your watch to them to have the band changed.  This along with most things done by them is about a 2 to 3 week turnaround. Along with a $20 charge for shipping and changing the band. They say it will void the warranty if you were to do it.  The other issue for me with this watch is if you want to upgrade it from the leather band to the bracelet ($700 is the cost for it) you cant as they say it is not interchangeable. Looks like it would only take the removal of a few links.  It is the same type of process if you want something repaired on a pair of oakley glasses like the X Metal Romeo or Juliet.  If you need what they call a \"tune up\" (the replacement of 4 tiny I MEAN TINY bushings in them which do tend to wear out) the cost of the bushings is $42 and again you send them to oakley. They will not send it to you even though this process can be done by anyone with the purchase of a small hex head screw driver.  This does not include the additional cost of shipping and the wait. So it is a great watch but Oakley is a litte shakey.', 765: 'I own about 15 watches...everything from a Casio Diver that I have had since college to a Panerai Luminor.  This is simply my favorite and I have literally worn it and no other for almost a year.  The design is stunning, one of a kind, magnanimous, unique, brilliant.  If you are a watch lover you will not be disappointed with this!  Kudos to Oakley for crushing \"the mold\".  Good luck finding a retail shop that carries these though!  I went everywhere, including Tourneau, probably the premier watch retailer in the country, and no one even heard of them.  So I bought it sight unseen (leather strap version) and I LOVE IT.  YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS.  Note: it is HUGE but I love big watches (ala Panerai etc.)', 766: 'This watch vault is very convenient to store large (and small) watches, it keeps the watch safe from bumping into other items or watches in the drawer, or in your bag while travelling. It has the perfect size and serves its purpose, I definitely recommend this product.', 767: \"I bought this for travel purposes.  I have a few nice watches and I like to bring more than one when I travel so I got 2 of these things.  They are very nicely built.  Fits even my bigger watches like the Panerai.  The interior is a nice soft material that I believe won't scratch my watches.  I am happy so far!  I would highly recommend if you need something to protect your watches for travel.\", 768: \"I love this case. I prefer this to the flat cases since several of my watches will not lie flat where the band attaches to the watch. It works great although I'm sure that there are some watches out there that will not fit. Use common sense; if you've got some humongous watch then don't be shocked if it doesn't fit in this case. For me it works with all of my 15 watches even my small dive computer. $20 though is a little on the pricey side. I think I got it for much less during a Lightning sale.\", 769: 'Great item. Can fit my 45.5mm omega planet ocean. The outer shell has a cool kevlar look to it. And the inner is lined to protect your watch from scratches.', 770: 'A little pricey, but a good travel case for my watches. It holds up to 44 mm no problem; none of my watches are over that, so not sure on bigger pieces.', 771: 'Useful travel item, my son who travels a lot for business willl love it.  One of those things you wonder why you never bought before.  Nice looking and well made.  Large means big enough for a large watch - the case itself is small and perfect size to stick in some empty corner of a suitcase.', 772: \"I don't understand the negative ratings.  It's nice and plush on the inside.  The cloth shell maintains its shape well.  The zipper is high quality.  Great case to keep in my car.  My rolex 41mm fits nice in there.\", 773: \"Well, it fits a large watch. What I can say is that I'm using it to store a 50mm Suunto Ambit and it fits well without any movement. I could shake the case without anything rattling, so it does what I wanted it to do.Not too sure it will work as well with a Rolex 42mm.  I assume you need a small size case for that.\", 774: \"I use this for a Diamond Bulova Marine Star watch when I travel. The case is surprisingly rigid. I have heard some complaints in the past that this cases inner zipper is not protected (which is a concern for my watch since it has a black enamel band and bezel and can easily be starched.)I can safely say I have yet to produce any issues with the internal zipper scratching my watch after transporting my watch around in this... even with rattling and shifting in my bags. The zipper teeth themselves are plastic so this likely wont cut into metal.Also, the zipper tends to be set on the outer part of the shell. I noticed if you fold back the zipper, so the zipper kinda tucks around the outer lip of the shell, it never touches the watch at all. If this is a concern be sure to tuck the zipper back along the shell. I think even without this step it's a non issue.Overall this is a great product to store your watch when you travel or if you need a case for your desk while you are at work.\", 775: 'I Have several Oakley watches and travel a lot. This case is great to help me protect my collection as I travel. Not a great deal at $20 but I needed a case. MSRP is $20.

I will be using this with my Seiko Astron (fits perfectly, 47mm diameter) when I fly. This way I do not have to place my naked watch in the bins and possibly end up with a scratched finish at the aiprot. I purchased 2 of these items. Worth every penny.', 778: \"I'm extremely satisfied with this product. I was able to store my 46mm(large size) watch with no problems. I would recommend this case to anybody. Thanks to Oakley for a great product.\", 779: \"I always keep one of these around, great to store your watch when you don't plan on bringing a watch box.

And I always primarily face two dilemmas:- At the airport, where to put my watch for a body search (so it doesn't get tossed around / or get scratched)- During travels, especially long hauls...wouldn't just having one watch be boring and maybe out of occasion, in case I needed a combination of a dress watch and a diving watch for example.I had begun looking for a nice portable, durable case and most of what was available pointed to the Oakley 07-234. Then came the search to find it locally in Singapore but to no avail. Decided on Amazon and it cost USD20, shipping was USD9.98.It finally came and I had brought it along two trips already before writing this review.I would say the design is a simple clam-shell. Light and compact. Somewhat durable and sturdy (elephant sitting on it would definitely squash it) but in your luggage or haversack...a breeze to bring around. Would classify it an Oakley trademark - designed for outdoors. It is certainly of good quality.The material inside is soft and would be gentle with your wrist possession. It fits almost big shape and sizes BUT only one piece.This now provides an option of carrying at least two watches on my travels. Overall am very delighted with this case.PROS- small and compact, light- gentle inside enough for your watch, hard enough outside to prevent knocksCONS- small could be achilles heel for some people. Negligible, prone to misplacement if careless- pricey (subjective - but worth it in my opinion)Recommended for travellers especially. Thanks Amazon\", 787: 'Bought this case from a local Oakley store. It is shaped ergonomically for watch storage and the case is very durable. The inside is lined with a soft felt that keeps the watch protected. I will probably buy another one of these!', 788: 'I use this every day to store my watch.  great for travel.  Very easy to place the watch in this and zip it up.', 789: 'This fits all of my (men\\'s sized) watches just perfectly. I feel no problem putting an expensive watch in this and tossing it in to my backpack with other things. It overall seems well-built and should stand up to a bit of abuse while protecting any watch inside. It says \"soft vault storage case\" but it is actually more rigid then you may think, not at all like fabric. See my other reviews for some of the watches I own.', 790: 'I bought this as a gift for someone and I really liked it. It fits even his wide watches and is great for his travel. Would buy again.', 791: \"Fits a 40+ watch dial well and protects the watch from basic scratches or denting. I usually throw it in my bag when I travel and when I'm not wearing my watch, I store it in the case. The case works but its somewhat cheaply made. It does the job but at $20 bucks, its a bit high.\", 792: 'Awesome product.  Light weight yet exceptionally strong.  Holds very large watches - up to 50+mm in diameter.  Easy storage inside a golf or tennis bag.  Definitely would buy again.  Solid Oakley Quality!', 793: \"I am very happy with this watch case.  It's more expensive, but worth it.  The other cases look cheap and you know it'll start to break down right away.  I use it everyday when I get to the gym and change clothes.  I used to just put my watch in my pocket but it would get scratched up with my keys and phone.  Now I just put it in this case and throw it in my bag!  The description says soft, but I think it protects it very well.  I like the way this stores my watch because it can't fold flat.  And coming from Oakley, you know its a quality product!  Oh yeah, I bought two.  One to use everyday and another to hold my more expensive watch at home.\", 794: \"I have two Oakley Saddleback watches and this case fits either one perfectly!

I would rate five stars if the zipper were constructed a little better.  Would like to see better quality control at this price point.\", 800: 'This case is really awesome.

Then i unzipped the vault to discover that the watch is still in it's place and didn't move, and by that the vault has served it's true purpose!P.S. I bought the small vault for a 41mm Omega SMP and its perfect, but for larger dial watches you should go for the Large size Oakley vault.\", 815: \"Great for your watch.  Fits perfectly.  Only bad news is that Oakley is clueless.

Pictures dont do it justice and you can find the watch for $700.00 instead of the $1200.00 retail price if you look around a bit. Its big and chuncky and titanium how can you go wrong. You cant see it in most pictures but it has a anti-reflective coating on the crystal lens that adds a little flare (lense turns blue and/or purple color in certain light) as well. Comes packaged nicely with a wooden case and its lined in leather.Highly recommended besides what is the point of having a nice watch if it looks like everyone elses...', 818: \"This watch was an eye catcher from the day I worn it out. Everyone noticed this watch on my wrist and immediately people were asking where did I get this watch. I bought this watch directly from Oakley but I love letting people know about items I buy on Amazon. I have posted several pictures of the watch when I first received it and I hope it helps you in your decision making.First off, your guess is right. This is a big watch and a little on the heavy side but because its Titanium its not as heavy as you would think. The watch is quartz so you know it will keep it's time and it is also mechanical. It has a very impressive 14 jewels inside for barrings. I would not wear this watch every because I have girly thin wrist but for some of you bigger guys this will fit you quit well. After some adjustments this watch fit me perfectly and looked great as you can see from my pictures. The adjustments were very easy compared to your regular style of watches. The side bolts unscrew very easily and don't need a lot of force to come off. When tightening all you need is for the screw to be in. Do not over tighten the screws.The crystal on this watch shows a tint of blue but I feel its because of the black face. The black seemed a better fit for me because the hands were easier to see. The silver face blends in too much with the hands and is hard to tell time with. All in all this watch is very beautiful to look at and tells time on a dime. But I have only had the watch for a short time. I was very impressed by the packaging, it came in a hardwood dark brown box with white leather interior. I recommend if you plan on using this watch everyday that you buy the watch carrying case for easy and safe storage. It's a great item to buy. Oakley has thought of the consumer with the storage case and I thank them for it. Also Oakley backs their product so if you ever have any problems with the watch just call them. Oakley has always answered any questions that I have had and they will do the same for you.Last this watch is made of Titanium and it will not tarnish. The rubber links are made of carbon-fiber and it acts as a lubricant between the Titanium links in the bracelet. The watch is very stylish and everyone will want to see it. So if you are interested in having something that will have people looking at your wrist and asking you questions this is the watch for you. Every feature and function in this watch is Swiss made so there should be no worry of craftsmanship.If this review has helped you please let me and let Amazon know. Thank you for your time and enjoy your searching.\", 819: \"Definitely one of my favorite watches. Excellent time accuracy, feels unusually comfortable on the wrist (it is not heavy due to the titanium), and is literally a snap to set, take off and put on. Calendar date is clearly visible (I really like that). Very easy to add/remove links for perfect adjustment. This watch is unique in that it will draw attention from strangers. Many people have commentated that the links are like half-bullets. I really dig the macho look but some will not. My watch was customized with an all black face (dials are black) and Ti bracelet via a dealer on the web. Strongly recommend that you try the watch on at an Oakley store before buying. You can't be neutral about the looks of this thing. People will either love it or hate it so bring your significant other to the store. Note that the rectangular face is much larger than it appears from photographs and will dominate the band looking down on smaller wrists.A couple of negatives: Very weak luminescence. At night I can't discern an accurate time since the hands are barely covered with luminescent material and there is no luminescence at critical locations around dial. The battery can only be replaced via shipment to Oakley in California (costly) and takes over a month to replace and return. Battery lasts about two years, then abruptly runs out. The stopwatch is very difficult to make out (small marks on upper left dial) and counts to a maximum of thirty minutes before repeating. Since I primarily use the stopwatch to keep track of parking meter time, this is a problem.Despite having quite a few Gshocks, Tasers and Dive watches, this one is usually on my wrist.\", 820: 'Had this watch for 2 years now, been using it quite regularly and still works and looks like it did the day I first wore it, Well, aside from minor scratches, but still looks great.I definitely agree with the first 2 reviewers about the coolness factor of this Machine. Honestly, I get more compliments from this watch than my Oakley time bomb 2.', 821: 'Normally I use these for bicycling, I like the full coverage of the eyes and surrounding area thereby stopping grit, gravel and bugs. I also wore them recently on a 6 week tour of Italy in which I drove over 2,000 miles mostly in bright sunshine.  I like the strength and resistance to impact by gravel, I like the clarity and the elimination of UVA/UVB protecting my eyes from deterioration.', 822: 'they arrived on time they fit just right into my M Frame they look good and I have not had a problem with them since purchasing them. I would definitely purchase them again when needed.', 823: \"Finally found a way to overcome my husband's careless treatment of his sunglasses. Apart from enticing him to treat them with more care, this was the best solution. The glasses came with easy to mount instructions. His favourite sports glasses look like new again!\", 824: 'The fire iridium lenses are one of the best products that Oakley has made in the last number of years. I thoroughly enjoy this product from Oakley, the standard in eye protection.', 825: 'I will put it this way...  If you are a hunter and shooter, buy them.  If you want to use them in combat, they work and protect your eyes past safety eyewear standards for ballistic protection.  If you want to wear them for shooting range work, the protect your eyes. They fit great under shooting muffs or peltors / sordins.  They are Oakley and just plain work and not cheap in function or clarity.', 826: 'Great purchase. I love these glasses and the Olive Tortoise shell is discontinued so hurry up! The lens scratches easily though.', 827: 'excellent watch the only thing is I was sent the wrong color which upset me a little since the color I got was my second choice.  I didnt want to go thru the hazzle of sending it back.  love the watch but got the silver face instead of white.', 828: \"Excellent looking watch - heavy, but not as heavy as it could have been.  Classy, sharp, yet pretty darn tough looking.  As 'large' as the watch is, it keeps a rather low profile not catching everything as I swing the arm around.  Pretty impressed with the watch and it definitely grabs the attention of others.  It's pricey, but haven't really experienced buyer's remorse from the purchase, so I must say I'm very impressed.\", 829: \"This isn't a good watch. No, It is the absolute best watch I have ever owned.  Everyone asks about it. It gets nothing but compliments from everyone.

I highly recommend this great piece of art to anyone!\", 830: 'great', 831: 'As you can imagine \"safety\" is a top priority;to accomplish this your vision must be always SHARP!These glasses do a great job;you will love them,as I do!', 832: \"I am an avid runner and cyclist and was looking for a good pair of shades to wear while running and biking without breaking the bank. I've love the style of the Oakley Radars and have always wanted a pair, but I couldn't justify spending the $200+ on them. After searching the internet I found these on Amazon for around $140 through &#34;US Power Sellers&#34; but fulfilled by Amazon, qualifying for Amazon Prime shipping. Still a little pricey, but definiltey doable. I read a few reviews on Amazon where some customers were complaining  about recieving Fakes from some sellers. It made me a little nervous but I decided to go through with the order. I am really glad I did. The Oakley Radars are amazing. It came with the Radar Path lenses and they fit great. Everything came in the Genuine Oakley packing with warranty information and manuals and included the frame/lens, extra nose piece, soft bag, and the vault case. I have no doubt, these are definitley authentic Oakley Radar glasses. I have had many pairs or cheap glasses and fake Oakleys in the past and the difference is amazing. I can't belive how comfotable these are. They're definitley not flashy, being just the Black frames and lenses, but I was looking for somthing pretty nuetral and I think that is why I got such a good deal. The colored frames and lenses were almost twice as expensive. Definitley happy with my purchase. 5 Stars\", 833: \"These shades have been amazing running in them.  I ran 24 miles the other week in preparation for a marathon and these bad boys did well in staying snug.  Can't comment a whole lot on the included lenses since I bought a photochromic replacement that I have been using.The one thing I have to say that really isn't a bad thing for these glasses since i think it'll happen no matter what brand/style you wear, but I had a lot of sweat drip down the inside and outside of my glasses while running.  It could be because of my thick eyebrows that build up a lot of sweat and/or the shape of my face that makes it easy for this to occur.  But it wasn't anything a quick wipe with my shirt couldn't fix in a jiffy.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase as a long-distance runner.PS They're not bad for wearing when not exercising too.\", 834: \"I have been wanting some Oakley's of this style for a long time but I didn't wanna spend the $200.  I have to say they are worth it!  I have had plenty of lesser shades but I am a believer in Oakley now.  I am gonna start looking around for replacement lenses!\", 835: 'This is my 4th oakley order from amazon. The earlier one identical to this was stolen. I ordered radar range before this but found the lenses too large for my face. My cheeks were holding up the glasses not my nose. Radar path is perfect. My nose holds it up and there is a space between cheeks and bottom of the lenses so the air inside the lenses is not cooped up. Like all oakleys, the eye protection from glare and extreme brightness, at least on these dark lenses is perfect. Great for golf, the beach and simply bright sunny days.', 836: \"I wasn't expecting this glasses to be as amazing as they are. Great fit. The picture shoes a kind of pinkish frame but keep in mind the actual glasses are a deep red (Which I knew before purchasing) when the sun hits the lenses the color is great and woooo I just love these sunglasses\", 837: \"I've worn a pair of these while riding about 6,500 miles both on the road and off the road. My review, in twenty-five words or less: they are excellent glasses for all kinds of cycling.They stay put. No matter what position my head is in, they don't move around, whether I'm on the road bike or the mountain bike. I don't ride aero bars, just regular road bike bars, so I'm not craning my neck as much as some riders; if you ride aero bars, you may want to try these glasses in a brick-and-mortar retailer before buying. The design keeps them off my face enough to keep some air moving and make them resistant to fogging (especially when I use vented lenses), but at the same time I don't get much in my eyes. I tried a pair of Split-Jackets with vented lenses, and they will fog in cooler weather. The Radar Paths are perfect for the shape of my head/face.The optics are great and they feature interchangeable lenses. I find that when the weather cools off, the unvented lenses I prefer tend to fog up when I stop. So I switch to vented lenses, and they almost never fog, even when it's in the 30F range and I stop after riding hard.They are pricey, but you get what you pay for. I tried different glasses from three different brands before I settled on these Oakley Radar Paths. In cycling, it's not unwise to spend money on your contact points (bars, pedals/shoes, saddle/bibs) AND on your eyewear. These glasses are great.\", 838: 'I have had plenty of Oakleys and have always liked them.  Being an everyday runner, I have always look for sunglasses that protect my eyes from glare and sunshine and these are by far the best amongst the others I have had.  They fit very well and provide the right protection to your eyes in sun.', 839: 'These look great, and work great. I was doing sprints with these last year in the heat, while wearing them casually. They remind me of the video game &#34;Halo&#34; for some reason. Unfortunately they got stolen.', 840: \"I have had these for three years now, and they are just as crystal clear as on the day I bought them.  They offer perfect all-around vision and everything keeps its natural look.  They have held up to many falls and hits, the only scar is a small chip on the lenses from being dropped on a rock from a high height.  I would most definitely recommend these to anyone, especially if one plans on wearing them often.  Just make sure to clean them every week or so, you can't expect them to stay clean themselves.\", 841: 'my bf loves these so happy I purchased them great quality very worth the money. He loves the case the look of them everything. Very high quality.', 842: \"you really can't go wrong with these sunglasses for the price. My husband likes the way they fit and the lens is clear and protects from strong caribbean sun.\", 843: 'i bought these for my my cycling trips and just for everyday use and they are amazing they arrived before they were suppose to and are just amazing sunglasses for the active person', 844: 'Recommended as a stylish safety glass.  The frames will last years after the lenses get scratched.  New lenses $80.  Great glasses.', 845: 'I loved it. To my husband they were perfect. Very good price and excellent quality. very fashionable, with a fabulous design. I recommend it to everyone.', 846: 'they are even better than I expected...comfortable and light, cool sport design, and most importantly, burning sun of tropical areas: solved.', 847: \"Theses sunglasses are my 3rd pair of Oakley's in the past 20 years. Highly suggested as they fit perfectly and are very comfortable.\", 848: 'I wouldnt wear them anywhere else than on the golf course, but the lenses are great for the course / grass', 849: \"These are the first pair of Oakley sunglasses I have ever owned and I'm pretty impressed.  They really do stick to your face!  I rode on my bicycle for 18 miles in 105 degree weather the other day and they didn't budge even though I was drenched in sweat.  The tint on the lenses is perfect, not too dark and not too light in addition the frames are actually very light weight as well.  If you are serious about being active outdoors they worth every penny!\", 850: 'Love the way the lens contrast the on course scene.  Makes playing and looking for balls very comfortable on the eyes.  Highly recommend to golfers.', 851: 'Nice typical Oakley quality. Very clear lens, nice case. Beautiful glasses.Amazon was very easy and fast on shipment. I highly recommend these if your looking for some nice shades.', 852: 'Great tint for the PNW. From overcast to sunny and leisure to work outs these are perfect.', 853: 'These sunglasses are great. They seem to be for a smaller head though. I love the quality, the fit and the color of these sunglasses. I would buy these again.', 854: 'These sunglasses are very well made. My work involves being outside most of the day, and these are comfortable enough to wear all day. Sometimes debris can be flying around, and these sunglasses protect my eyes well. After having been hit several times by hard objects, the lenses show no sign of scratching. Expensive yes, but well worth the money!', 855: \"I've had this pair of sunglasses a week now. I purchased them for a 500 mile road trip to Panama City. The glasses have a snug but comfortable fit. They are easy to clean with the cloth bag they came with, there is also a spare/replaceable nose piece included in the package as well as a nice sturdy carrying case. I didn't care for the case, I have a hideaway in the top of my car where I store them, but it would be nice if I were packing the glasses in a suitcase. I would recommend these.\", 856: 'Lightweight and great coverage.  Have had many pairs of sunglasses and these are excellent for the money.  Polarized would be better, but you get what you pay for...', 857: \"I bought these sunglasses to replace a pair of Oakley Flack Jackets that I use when riding a motorcycle. I prefer Oakleys for this activity because they are very good optically and the shape of the FJs and these closely matches the contours of my face so I can ride with the visor up and my eyes dont water. Also the flexible and relatively short arms on the Oakleys fit well inside the helmet.and stay in place on my face.  I've done a couple of 'highway speed' rides with these and they are perfect.I had previously tried a pair of Maui Jims as the replacement for the FJs but they never seemed to fit right and slid down my nose, so they are now relegated to backup status.\", 858: 'I have been wearing Oakleys for years, I love the way they fit, stay on your face and last. I get years out of them and I will continue to buy Oakleys', 859: 'Excellent ergonomics, total solar protection, manufactured with materials of very good quality, is elegant and appropriate to make sport and also for casual use.', 860: 'The glasses do a great job of blocking UV rays and that helps control my migraines and sinus headaches. They are well constructed and very sturdy. Easy to clean too.', 861: 'My son is an avid biker (6,000 miles last year!),  and needed a new pair of sunglasses.  We wanted something cutting edge, with a good name to back it up for quality.  We were recommended these Oakleys,  and we are very happy we were!It was very important to me to get him excellent optics for clarity, comfort and protection.The Pluntonite lens filter out 100% to the UV, there is a coating so there is almost no glare, but his favorite part is that his glasses do not fog up.  They have a hydrophobic lens, which helps me feel he is safer out there on the roads and trails. Definite recommend.If my review helped you, please click on \"helpful\" below.

Excellent buy for the price vs stores...I bought as a gift but liked them so much I am getting myself a pair!', 867: \"Oakleys are Quality Product.  It is deceiving because they are light, giving an impression of being &#34;less or cheap or flimsy.&#34;  The truth is they are TOUGH, optically clear and scratch resistant.  Alas, I'm thinking the outrageous price is padded a little.  Yeah, free enterprise and all that... BUT.\", 868: 'i gave it as a gift for my husband a bit pricy but it fits him as he likes it he will use them till it breaks', 869: \"I have had a pair of Oakley Twenty XX's since about '99 and have loved them, and still do. But after roughly 14 years the nose pieces were lost and the ear socks just shredded. I decided it was time for a new pair and ordered a set of these.The style and fit are what I would expect, perfect. The optics are crystal clear and they are light weight, it is easy to forget I have them on. They just feel natural. That is why I like Oakley. Many cheap glasses are bulky, heavy and usually their darkening abilities sacrifice clarity or color/depth distortion or other visual anomalies. IE, the sky is blue, not pink, yellow, or any other strange hue common to the cheapos.If you find it hard to justify spending big bucks on sun glasses and use the $10 drugstore ones, find a friend or family member that has a set of (real) Oakleys and try them for a day. You'll probably find yourself buying a pair.On a side note; I found a nose piece/ear sock replacement kit on line for my old Twenty XX's and they are almost as good as new now. So now I use them as my recreation set (boating, hiking, etc) and the new ones for daily drivers. So, if you take care of them, they can last a darn long time, about 14 years and counting on my old set!\", 870: \"They seem a little snug but they're worth it because of the way they look...super cool! Great color combination and they make a great statement!\", 871: 'These are my third pair of Oakley sunglasses, and definitely my favorite.  I have had them for about a year and use them for just about anything, from cycling to running to everyday use, and they have held up perfectly.  I have the polished black frames with grey lenses and they are great for almost any light condition.  They will fit someone with a larger than average head (such as myself) without feeling uncomfortable at all.  They do grip the sides of your head more than most sunglasses, but I like this because it prevents them from falling off.  The clarity of Oakley lenses is unbeatable.  When I wear these, it feels like my normal vision, only darker.  If you are willing to spend around $150 for a pair of sunglasses, this is the pair to get.', 872: \"I use these babies primarily for cycling and running, and whenever I do anything else active. Very comfortable. They stay on. They're light, but sturdy. Great optics. Sweat doesn't phase them. And I think they look cool.

My only problem is they hurt my nose. After about 20 minutes, I have to take them off and reposition them. I've taken the nose piece off, turned it around (which helped a little) & taken it off. I'll learn to deal with it or find something to cushion the nose bridge. I do like the grey lens but do yourself a favor and get the polarized lenses.

I use the Radar regularly for cycling as well as for daily use. This pair of shades turns heads as well cause it looks really attractive with its sleek futuristic look. And the interchangeable lenses is the best part so I won't get bored with the same lens all the time as I can change the lens to a different colored one anytime and its very simple to remove and install lenses.

I kept coming back for more only because I had 2 inserts for them that had my prescription.  Another big disappointment with a pair of Rudy Project, expensive but total junk sunglasses.  I always wanted to own a pair of Oakley sunglasses.  I recently had cataract surgery which gave me 20/20 vision, and the first thing I did to celebrate was to buy a pair of Oakley Radar Iridium lensed sunglasses.They fit perfectly out of the large hard case, and the optics are incredible.

Another update 1/10: After daily wear while bicycle riding, the eye piece fell off, then the lens cracked. The crack was down the center above the nose piece. The sunglasses came with an extra nose piece, so I can use that. However, according to the manufacturer, the cracked lens is not covered by warranty. The lens did not fall apart, but is probably more vulnerable to future damage.', 911: 'These sunglasses are awesome. They fit great and stick to my head thanks to the unobtainium pads on the frame.

Lesson learned, I will never leave polarized again! Huge difference! I went to several sunglass stores and tried on many pairs before deciding on these. I like a lot of others, but they either didn't fit, didn't look good on me, or were WAY expensive! Tried these on, and they just spoke to me! Knew I could get them cheaper online, and the rest is history! Love these glasses!\", 934: 'This is a great product. High quality.

Because of the cost, I make sure i don't loose them.The only question I have is, does this pair come with the case and cleaning rag? Purchasing from a retailer i was given those two items. I would also suggest purchasing the Oakley cleaner. This stuff works great and i use it on my eye glasses as well. The lens are interchangeable but watch the Youtube videos on how to do it.

The rubber sole works pretty well absorbing the vibration at the footpegs compares with other riding boot..  excellent boot for multi-purpose use, once you wear it you dont want to take it out.. feels like addiction to wear it always..

Even considering that they are out of regulation (6&#34; is NOT what the Army regulation requires) I found them very comfortable and they adhere very good to the ground, so the traction is excellent too. The main reason I bough them was that my doctor required me to avoid high boots due to the fact that they block the flow of blood to my feet and make my calf veins pop out, even with them almost completely loose. So, I got a medical papers to back me up, just in case. I also tried them at the range and like I said before, excellent.

Perfect boots very comfortable', 984: \"I had my eye on these boots for a while and never had a reason to get them until I started riding motorcycles (street riding). When I bought them they were $245 but I figured that's about the price of a good pair street riding boots. At the time, I could not believe I paid that price for them.Let me say after two season of riding that these boots are the most incredible pair of shoes I have ever owned. I rode in a pair of Oxtar boots for half a season and they were flat soled, uncomfortable and are comparatively worthless.But after two seasons of heavy riding in my Oakley SI's they still have their tread, still have the same spring and support as the day I bought them and barely have scuffs to show for the wear (shifter wear, street wear, etc.). I'm looking forward to the day these boots do finaly wear out so I can run enthusiastically back to the Oakley store and plop down the $100+ for a new pair. These boots are worth every penny even at $245.If you ride a motorcycle, stand on your feet at work all day (get the lowtops) or of course are in the military (for which they were designed) or you want an all-around solid, comfortable boot then get these (black is the best color). I can promise you you won't be dissappointed.\", 985: 'I read a review that said these tend to run a bit large and he found that a half size under was the comfortable fit.

Lets face it, nobody wants to break in a pair for months.-I have had these boots for 8 months and they are durable as any boot I have owned.  Also with a shank in the sole for more stability.  Treads are still like new after walking on gravel everyday-The mid sole has a soft gel like material, which makes it very comfortable to wear.Cons-They tend to get a little toasty in the summer (I have the summer boots), so I wear the Nike boots then(because it is the lightest boots I have tried and very thin to help with the heat)-Price is pretty high.  I understand the topic of the high price for not being gortex, but the overall comfort is a lot better than Danners or the Rocky Sv2.  I wear these everyday, so spending a little more for quality shoes is something I can handle.Overall-This is a boot I will buy again.  I always have more than one pair, so if I needed waterproof boots or something for a different type of weather situation, then I can easily change the pair out.  As an everyday boot, Oakley's are it, even over my Nike's.  As for the sizing, I ordered my athletic shoe size and I haven't had a problem (with arch supports added)  It has a roomy toebox, which I like and ordering different widths are an option.  As for the price, I used USstandardissue.com and got a discount for being in the service, which reduced the price to the Danners and other boots I was considering.\", 987: 'Love these sunglasses.

The polarized lenses are optimum for outdoor activities in a variety of lighting conditions from bright and hazy to overcast.  Great for golf, driving, flying, or taking the bike out for a ride.  Extremely comfortable and light weight, often forget that I have them on.  If you are a sun worshipper, these are the ticket; the extremely slim temples ensure there is minimal, if any 'raccoon shadow' of your face if outside for very long.All in all, I have never been able to find anything negative about these shades...these are my second pair, and the only reason they are my second is because I left my first pair on an airplane accidentally....go me.....\", 989: 'I wear these almost all the time as driving sunglasses.

I have lost 6 pair. I keep buying them.  They are still up the the Oakley Standards.', 1019: \"This is the first pair of sunglasses I have purchased and worn in... a LONG time. So I'm not really comparing them to much more then themselves.First I got the Shallow Blue variant. Think the blue tint at certain angles is pretty cool. While not being blue the whole time.. if that makes sense. The glasses overall look well made and to be made of quality materials. Which I expected based on reviews and the brand of the product.Pros:GREAT clarity. Probably my favorite thing about them. Reduction of glare. No more squinting my eyes or angling the sun behind various objects to block it... Like my car's posts, visors, and rear-view mirror. This is the biggest win I have for these and my main reasoning for purchasing.Not a bad looking pair of sunglasses overall.Cons:Wish they were a little darker. I love the clarity and contrast. An acceptable trade off I suppose, but this one is based on expectations that they would be a little darker.The ends of the sunglasses pinch down on a somewhat uncomfortable part of my head. It's bearable though. Just a little inconvenient.  Might also just be my head? I don't know.It scratched. I have no idea why or how. But it did. I read that these iridium lenses can scratch easily. And they do. Be careful with these. I also heard that the frames and lenses themselves can stand up to some abuse, but definitely not the iridium layer stuff they use.In the end I would say buy them. Just be careful with them. Which, unfortunately, can be a difficult sometimes. And is a little irritating considering the price tag.

I LOVE THEM!!! I have always had difficulty finding a sun-glasses style that compliments the shape of my face. I found these and haven't looked at anything else since.In regards to the lens popping out situation....I am not sure what you are doing with your sunglasses. I accidentally dropped mine on the carpet and the lens popped out. Since they were brand new we had Oakley handle the fix. However, since then(over 2 years ago) I have dropped them on occasion. The lens has stayed put. No wiggle, no waiver. It has never popped out again. And believe me I held my breath a couple of times as they slipped from my fingers just knowing they were goners. But no. They are great. a bit scratched on the frame, a bit of a scratch on the lens. They still work great. Still look great!!Now if you were to sit on the frame, I could see there to be a problem. I have a few pairs of Oakley sunglasses. The others have the lenses that you slide out to change. I love them. Never had a problem with them popping out either. One pair I have had for over 18 years. The other around 2 years old.\", 1032: \"well... i didn't  have a problem with anything in my order.i purchased it few days before i travell so i needed to get it on the right time that i chose.so... the glasses are fine... the one that my boyfriend picked.that's it! you can trust in this store.\", 1033: 'I purchased these glasses three years ago almost to the day. I have had the problem where they popped out on me once but I brought them in to the Oakley store (any sunglass hut  will do this too) and found that the frames were slightly bent. This is common enough and an easy fix. If you had problems with them in this way that is what I would suggest you do. If when you call Oakley and they tell you that you need to pay more to get them fixed.. tell them you want to speak to a supervisor.They are light weight, they block harmful UV and UVA rays nicely. They act almost like blu-blockers would but much cleaner I think. I have a custom pair that my wife got for me and I need the polarization that these  provide as I got some medical issues with light sensitivity and these work perfectly!! You barely know when you are wearing them they are so light weight and fit nicely on the bridge of the nose. They are not that dark so you can wear them indoors if you should want.. not needed I am sure but can be done.I paid much more for these at the time I bought them and find that it was worth every penny. Oakley has an excellent reputation and they certainly lived up to it with these nice frames!!', 1034: 'I purchased these sunglasses for my husband after his very similar old model of these broke.

So far, very pleased. They are light weight, the rubber grips at the temples hold without irritating even when sweating profusely, and the Oakley lenses are optically correct. Not really an issue, but took a short while to adjust to the wide frame area at the side of the lens, which partially blocks peripheral vision. Can't speak for their longevity, as I have only had them a couple months.\", 1041: \"Ok I own a half wire Oakleys, and I had them for quit a while now, but I never thought that I could buy a pair for the Amazon advertised price.

I like them a lot, and bought different color lenses (from a different dealer), so I can wear the colors I'm in the mood for. Buyers beware: the polarized lenses are the best, and there is a difference that might spoil you when trying other lenses. Sometimes the lenses do press up against my eye lashes which means I have to clean them often. And sometimes aren't as comfortable with a baseball cap on (depending on which cap). Other than that they are awesome. They never move during most activities, which can be key.\", 1044: 'great product at a great price coupled with great customer service.

I really love them! The thing is after a little bit of use, I am starting to notice that the hinges to open and close the glasses is pretty loose. Meaning, if I hold facing lens up the it will slip about half way but stop there. From my experience with other glasses, they do the same thing. I'll be frank with you, it is not true that they are so comfortable that you might forget that their on your head. That said, they are very comfortable enough for me to play 3 sets in without getting uncomfortable. The hydrophobic coating is very useful for when your sweat drips of your hair on to the lenses. All in these are a great pair of glasses but I wouldn't say the best, then again I haven't seen any better. That's for you to find.P.S They DO come with a white microfiber cloth and a hard black case with extra inlays for 2 more pairs of lenses. The microfiber cloth does get pretty dirty from all the muck on the lens so I suggest buying a black one from somewhere and use that. Please do tell me if this will be helpful or not, it really helps. Thanks!!\", 1052: 'Seller and product great.

Thank you Amazon!!', 1054: \"These are my first ever pair of Oakleys.  I bought them primarily for running and cycling.  I had been wearing cheap supermarket sunglasses prior to these, and never had a pair last more than a month or two without breaking.  Fortunately, the Flak Jackets have performed flawlessly for me over a long Summer of pretty heavy abuse.  My number one requirement was that they needed to stay put on my face, without breaking due to snugness.  In that regard, the Flak Jackets have been perfect.  I have never once had an issue with them falling off or needing to be adjusted mid-run.  They are also showing no signs of stress or breakage whatsoever.  Additionally, the optics are night and day better compared to the cheapies I had been wearing before.  Everything is crystal clear, and water and sweat just kind of beads off the lenses.  These certainly aren't inexpensive, but they are easily worth the Amazon price I paid for them.  I would definitely buy them again.As a side note, I had initially purchased the Half Jacket 2.0s, and they were way too snug for my wider face.  So if you have a wide face and can't decide, the Flak Jackets are probably a better bet over the Halfs.\", 1055: \"I like to use my glasses when I am doing sports.

The Flak Jacket is by far my favorite.  They fit the best, not too tight, not too loose.  Low profile but cover all angles from sunlight.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is on the fence about this product.', 1059: 'Oakley sunglasses have always been my favorite.

Also, if you want to go to the beach or when you are driving they have a great performance. For these reasons, I recommend this sunglasses.\", 1066: \"I was hesitant to purchase these because I have a small face, but they fit great.

As I have been wearing them for a while I have worn them in many conditions. They do well in heat and dont really stick to you. They do well in wind as they funnel the wind around your eyes (which is important because some sunglasses let the wind into your eyes making it hard to see). They are very comfortable in every condition i have been in, except for one. The only time they aren't comfortable for me is when I am wearing over ear headphones, no matter how padded those headphones are (I have Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and those are very padded). There is something about the lenses that blocks the suns UV rays better than others I have tried and you can look at the sun for 30 seconds (not recommended to do so though) and not even hurt your eyes (but it probabaly is still bad for your eyes so don't do it). I have heard that the lens scratch easily but i haven't had a problem with that (but I do try to take good care of them so I can't be sure how easily they scratch). Overall though, I absolutely love these sunglasses and would suggest them to anyone who wants to look stylish or just feel comfortable or even both. I hope this review helped you and thank you for taking the time to read this.\", 1070: \"I paid full price from a retailer for these glasses about 2 years ago.  They're lightweight and comfortable.  They've been dropped, stepped on (arm snapped off but popped right back in), have survived several road and mountain bike crashes, came through several collisions with large insects (bees and dragonflies) at 20+ mph, and have been exposed for days at a time to chlorine and saltwater - all with no problems other than one small scratch to one of the lenses.  About 2 weeks ago I misplaced them.  About 1  week ago I finally gave them up for lost and ordered a replacement pair from Amazon.I paid about $50 less than I paid at the original retailer and they arrived as promised within two days.Great glasses - I highly recommend them.\", 1071: \"These glasses look good and are very comfortable.  Harsh midday glare is very painful for me and these knock out the glare without sacrificing the clarity of what I'm trying to see, such as traffic.

Looking for another pair for the spring.', 1073: \"These are very good sunglasses, and Oakley lenses certainly provide excellent UV protection and clarity. They fit very comfortably and are extremely lightweight. But, as is usual with the Oakley brand, they aren't worth the cost (especially at the borderline criminal MSRP!) The iridium coating is useful but scratches VERY EASILY. Seriously I don't even know what causes the scratches, they just seem to appear out of nowhere. Also you get an annoying reflective glare of your own eyeball when you look towards the sun. Finally the standard Flak Jacket lens doesn't quite provide complete coverage (but the XLJ fixes that). Don't get me wrong, its a killer looking pair of shade with very good lenses and decent durability, but for the money you'd expect a much more solid construction than what you're actually getting.\", 1074: \"I've been buying Oakley sunglasses for 10yrs even got issued a few in the military.  I've even bought Oakley's that weren't the ones i wanted because the pics on the website weren't very good few years ago, but I must say even those are comfortable and are the BEST sunglasses you can buy!

The root beer/brown/bronze lens by itself cuts down on the glare, increases contrast as well as color. The polarized lenses here in the Seattle area are a God send.

The fit very well and are so comfortable I forget I\\'m wearing them.  Partly this is due to the fact that they are rimless on the bottom of the frame.They do a good job in bright and direct sunlight.  These are not low-light shades like the \"Gold Iridium\" lenses which allow much more light.  Also, I find that the Black lenses do not enhance contrast as much as Gold Iridium, so you see less detail in shadowed areas, but have better glare reduction in bright light.Overall, I am a fan of these glasses.

Excellent product!!\", 1123: \"I am in love since 2008 when I tried it on a peruvian mall, when I could not purchase (was going to be there for a long time because of work stuffs) but then I found it on Amazon at very low price.

However, it grew on me over time.  It is much more durable than it appears and looks too nice to bring out of the office anyway.  The band is extremely comfortable; I can wear it all day, everyday without having to take it off.Get this watch for the office and off-duty; get something like a G-Shock for everything else.Also, if you are a government employee (DoD and local LEO), go through Oakley's government sales for a significant price reduction.Pros:-Heavy, solid frame-Extremely comfortable band-Tougher than it looks-Elegant design-Swiss madeCons:-Doesn't appear to be rugged enough for field training/exercise/etc. (I'd prefer something like a Casio G-Shock for these things)-Runs on a battery (I prefer automatic watches)\", 1128: 'I\\'m a teacher with somewhat limited funds, but I didn\\'t mind spending $550 for this Oakley two years ago. I\\'ve been wearing this watch non-stop since the day I purchased it - don\\'t take me literally, I don\\'t shower or sleep with it on, though I guess I could. The band is very comfortable on my 7\" inch wrist and the watch does not weigh too much even though it is well constructed.The reason I did not give it five stars is that there is a very thin crevice encircling the watch head (see my picture) that has collected a small amount of crud over the past two years. Also, the battery went dead only a year-and-a-half after purchasing it. If yours goes dead, send it to Oakley to get it replaced. I spent $15 for a battery replacement at a jewelry store in the mall and now the chronograph functions do not operate properly, though it does tell time correctly. Still, overall I am very happy with my purchase.', 1129: 'Great watch good price', 1130: \"I've worn a pair of these while riding about 4000 miles both on the road and off the road. My review, in twenty-five words or less: they are excellent glasses for all kinds of cycling.They stay put. No matter what position my head is in, they don't move around, whether I'm on the road bike or the mountain bike. I don't ride aero bars, just regular road bike bars, so I'm not craning my neck as much as some riders; if you ride aero bars, you may want to try these glasses in a brick-and-mortar retailer before buying.The optics are great and they feature interchangeable lenses. I find that when the weather cools off, the unvented lenses I prefer tend to fog up when I stop. So I switch to vented lenses, and they never fog, even when it's in the 30F range and I stop after riding hard.They are pricey, but you get what you pay for. I tried different glasses from three different brands before I settled on these Oakley Radar Paths. In cycling, it's not unwise to spend money on your contact points (bars, pedals/shoes, saddle/bibs) AND on your eyewear.

In the woods they evened out the light and shadow spots. Came out into an open sand area and never realized how bright it really was.

Not as dark as the grey lenses but help to even out the light.', 1134: 'the replace lens are pretty good to use during the night or cludy days. you can see everything even riding during the night. the item arrived on time and in perfect conditions.', 1135: 'I recently used these lenses on a ski trip to Big Bear and I must say that they work excellent! The fire iridium was able to remove all glare and make the sunny slopes very easy on the eyes. Great lenses!', 1136: \"These lenses are great. I bought these to replace the dark gray lenses on  my Radar Paths that were scratched up from use. I love how much these lenses reduce the glare & make everything brighter.I've been suffering from migraine headaches my whole life & too much sun or glare can trigger a migraine. Cheap sunglasses can also trigger a severe migraine. I can wear these all day without problems. The blue & purple color on the outside of the lense compliments the purple logo & ear socks of the Infinite Hero Radar Paths.I would definitely recommend these lenses to anyone looking to replace the lenses on their Oakleys.\", 1137: 'These replacement lenses were priced high - but so are all the other replacement lenses.

I'll definitely recommend Oakley to my friends and relatives.  Great glasses!\", 1141: \"The Oakley Radar Path was my first pair of Oakley and I absolutely love it. Mine is the Asian fit model with the Carbon Fiber frame. Model ref number 09-740J. Its really worth my money. Its lightweight, durable and is very comfortable. It fits my face perfectly, no slips whatsoever thanks to the good rubber/unobtainium grips of the nose pad and the earstems. Probably the most comfortable pair of shades I've ever worn. The clarity of the lens is just fantastic, Oakley's High Definition Optics (HDO) at its best! I use the Radar regularly for cycling as well as for daily use. This pair of shades turns heads as well cause it looks really attractive with its sleek futuristic look. And the interchangeable lenses is the best part so I won't get bored with the same lens all the time as I can change the lens to a different colored one anytime and its very simple to remove and install lenses. Additional replacement lenses come separate of course and are quite pricey depending on the style. But other than that, as far as I know, I can't find any cons for my Radar Path so far.

I typically ride in the late afternoon/early evening and these lenses seem to provide enough contrast as the sun sets without being too dark.One thing I noticed is that they don\\'t fit as snug in the frame as the original positive red iridium lens that came with my glasses.

I have used them heavily in a ruff area so i have ordered my replacement lenses with fear of them being discontinued after having them for 9 months with daily use.

Also some time around last year I noticed that the upper inside of the lens on both sides were wearing away, I assume from sweat. I bought these and replacement ear socks...and the glasses are like brand new. People ask why I spend so much on glasses.....when you do you don't &#34;lose&#34; them or sit on them, you take care of them, and with these replacement parts, I'll have them at least another 5 years. When was the last time you wore a pair of glasses for 10 years....you just can't beat Oakley for eye where The gold lens are GREAT for color and depth.

The packaging was very secure and safe, and the lenses were brand new. I didn't have any issue putting them on, as a few others mentioned. I did have to pull the plastic around the lens housing a bit in order for them to fit - probably because I had never taken off the original ones before... not sure.I can see clear again, and always make sure to have a good Micro-Fiber cloth to keep them dirt and scratch free.

Too BAD Oakley discontinued this range for the &#34;ugly & bulkier&#34; 2.0, which looks ok, only if you have a square face.

The watch itself is pretty distinctive, it will get noticed.  It is fairly chunky, but with the unobtanium band, by far from the heaviest watch I own.  It is very comfortable, and very rugged.  I have worn this watch on a nearly daily basis (it's my go to watch) and other than battery replacements, it has never missed a beat.  If, like me, you end up wearing out the band, good luck finding a replacement (apparently this is why it's called unobtanium....).  That being said, this watch has survived many years with not a scratch, not a broken band pin, not a single drop of water inside the face.  I have worn and trashed many other (cheaper) watches over the years, and can say that this watch will pay for itself over time.Summary - eye catching watch stands up to abuse.\", 1246: \"I've owned the Oakley Holeshot for a year and this is what I've found:Pros:Looks / Design. I'm in a part of the world where custom dictates that if someone admires a possession of yours then you give it to them. I've had a few people make comments, repeated comments, about my watch. I was rude and kept it. What can i say.Holds up well to rough wear. I've dropped and banged it a few times. Due to its design, whenever it fell it landed on the glass. No scratches.Buttons are easy to manipulate when running.Dial illuminates well.Cons:The stopwatch second hand doesn't reset to 12. It resets to 11:59. Not sure of the reason, if its a mechanical failure or because of damage. It has no loss of function, just doesn't go back to 12.Unfortunately my wrist size is in between band holes so it's either a little to tight or a little too loose. The only time this is an issue is when I'm running. Because of its weight it wants to always rotate.I wouldn't say I'd buy it again, but I definitely don't regret buying it.\", 1247: 'Awesome watch, it goes with everything I wear, including dress clothes. Highly recommend this watch.', 1248: 'Heavy as hell but oh so durable. Looks beautiful on my wrist and is very handsome looking. The price was a bit steep. Wish I had waited for the price to come down.', 1249: \"This is my first polarized Oakley. The difference between Oakley lens and cheaper sunglasses is quite obvious. The tint of the lens is perfect for blocking out light, on a boat or driving. I love the lightweight feeling of these sunglasses. Only gripe is that if you look down, the lens will not over a portion of light and if the sun is directly overhead, the rays can create a glare from the inside of the sunglasses when the rays between your eye brows and the lens. Thus, these sunglasses don't tape onto your face to block light from every single direction. But for most uses it suffices. unlike other sunglasses, these oakleys won't move at all when you shake you head so its useful when you're active (you'll probably injure your neck before you dislocate these half jackets). I stil have to test out the durability of the lens and how scratch-prone or proof they are (haven't had any scratches after daily use for a month). As for the frame, its nearly indestructible by daily use around town, sitting on it, or outdoor adventures (I've used had the same frame before). There are no screws that get loose or rusty. The pieces of the frame just snap into place. In fact, the part that clinches your ear is flexible too. At its price, it's still an expensive pair of sunglasses but depending on its durability of the lens, it may be a worthy investment for years to come. Plus its very stylish (imho) On another note, the asian fit really does fit my asian head better than any other sunglasses I've owned. I love the engineers at oakley! Favorite pair of sunglasses out of the few I've owned.On a side note, I waited to get these until amazon had a sunglasses sale.\", 1250: 'It was an excellent choice.

Only just barely.I have  taken to ordering a size 12.5 in shoes and boots.Good news. So far each set of shoes/boots I have bought at 12.5, fit.Bad News. Almost, not quite, impossible to find anyone that does a 12.5.Makes no sense but there you are. I guess only people with little feet can have half size feet. Go figure.Oakley (thank you so VERY much) makes a size 12.5.Now to the boot.The style and fit are superb.They hug w/o pinching my foot.Toe box is wide and comfortable. Thick socks or thin.I will be wearing them for hiking boots so will see how they stand the test of time, as it were.I also will start wearing them when riding my motorcycle. Black mark on the left boot is a badge of honor.

I got this info from the Oakley site.Don\\'t figure this is a show stopper. I mean my jungle boots weren\\'t waterproof and, like these, I just will let them dry on my feet if I get them wet.They are a kind of a suede so will get \"character\" in a hurry. If you need a uniform boot (something that polishes well), try one of the blacks/brown (not seen here) options.These things are light and fit well.The quick lace eyelets are a bit different. I like to use Kevlar laces in my boots and they will not fit in these eyelets.

While there are probably a lot of better motorcycle-specific boots on the market, for what the Oakley Tactical does, it does wonderfully.  The size was perfect for my foot.  I had read that it does run big so to order a 1.2 size smaller than normal.  I heeded this advice and it worked perfect.  The boot looks outstanding with a pair of jeans, and was very comfortable out of the box.  There was virtually no break-in period required.  The good, the bad and ugly:The Good:+ Appearance/Looks.  A classic looking boot, nice lines.+ Virtually break-in free.  The base and leather is very soft and flexible.  For me, there wasn\\'t any break-in required.+ Good traction from the sole.The Bad:+ Not fully waterproof.  While Oakley doesn\\'t market this boot as a waterproof boot, I would expect some level of inherent protection regardless.  Water can easily seep in between the tongue and shoelace holes.+ Fit is about 1/2 size large so plan accordingly.+ No steel toe or shank (for weight reduction).The Ugly:+ Nothing.While the price might be a deterrent, this boot would serve well for \"dry\" hiking, motorcycle riding or even as a work book.  It\\'s lack of a steel toe and shank might not make this an ideal boot for working with power tools.', 1279: 'I was looking for a comfortable lite weight boot, and that is what I got.

Overall they are super comfortable with any socks and the gel sole absorbs more shock than you could imagine. Great boot for hiking, work, or any activity.', 1282: 'Yesterdays wet weather proved no problem, feet stayed dry.  Have yet to have a really cold day to remark on the insultation or traction on ice, nor had them long enough to determine longevity.  Roomy shoes will allow me to wear two layers of socks on really cold days.  [added this after 2.5 years of occasional use - The soles wear faster than I would like walking on asphalt or concrete. So if you do mostly city walking as opposed to woods you might want to find a sole material that will wear better on pavement.  Grass and mud are no problem, good traction on ice. And very good keeping feet dry in snow, but if you step in water that reaches the flaps, they leak immediately.]', 1283: 'The shoes are very nice.However, they are a little loose in the toe area and the tongue could be a little longer.I was hesitant to buy shoes without trying them on, but these fit.

The SI Assault felt more like a tennis shoe than a boot. But these fit and feel like BOOTS. They are very lightweight and have a rugged-enough sole and were comfortable out of the box. I've got a 6 foot 4, 215 lb frame and didn't have to worry about breaking them in at all, just put them on, laced them up and tramped around in them all day without any discomfort at all. I found them to be sized just right as well, so I wouldn't buy a size different from what you normally wear.The only qualm I have is with the tongue, which is too short. When you lace them all the way up and tie the laces the tongue doesn't stretch up far enough to keep the laces clear of your leg. The tongue should at least have a little clearance over the top of the boot. Other than that, this boot is aces.\", 1287: 'wear them everday for work and play.so far they have held up well and the soles seem to last.Very comfortable but the summer heat is coming and they appear to be a winter boot but the summer will tell.would get another pair', 1288: 'This is thee most comfortable boot you will ever wear!

Basic Military boots too high or not enough support.These boots will be comfortable and reliable. Whether you are going light or packed to the hilt.Highly recommended', 1290: \"12/13/12  I purchased these boots for my fiance as a gift and he just loves them.  I showed the online photo and description of them prior to purchasing them.  We measured his foot according to the sizing information provided next to where you choose your size.  According to the sizing chart his foot measurement indicated that he would need a 7 1/2.  I doubt he has ever had a 7 1/2 in his life...usually a 6 1/2 or 7, but thankfully we did not ignore their sizing chart as when he tried them on the 7 1/2 is what he needed in this boot which tells me you need to order a half size larger than your normal size.  My fiance is a contractor and has many work boots, but never a 7 1/2.  They are made very nice and really look more expensive than the price shown.  He is really happy with them and will use them more for casual dress going out in cold damp weather, walking, hiking, etc.  He won't be using them to work in.  Really, they are too nice to destroy and use as a work boot, but additionally my fiance does not feel they are quite sturdy/hardy enough to use as a work boot.  He doesn't feel they would last too long for construction work use.  We like to walk in the winter and I think they will be nice for this.  Not as bulky as his Sorels...which do have their place also.I purchased these from Altrec and am not happy with their packaging.  The boots come in a box provided by the manufacturer.  Altrec did not put this box inside of another box for protection....they just put the box inside a large plastic envelope which obviously provided no protection and the shoe box is pretty battered up.  I'm not happy with that at all as we store all shoes, boots, etc in the manufacturer's box.Update..1.15.13  I contacted the Seller, Altrec within a few days after delivery (12/10/12) and advised them of the battered box due to their poor packaging.  To date...again...1/15/13...I have never heard from Altrec which I am not happy about.  I have just filed a complaint so we will see what happens.  I'm still giving the boots 5 stars as the poor shipping packaging has nothing to do with the boot, but I want others to be alerted to this problem with this Seller.  The boots are very nice!1/29/13 UPDATE  The boots have now been put through their paces.  On Saturday, 1/26/13 my fiance wore these for a good 15 hours.  We had allot of running around to do and since it was so cold here in South New Jersey and we had some snow and ice around he wore them for the day.  We were dressed I guess what you would call dressy casual.  The boots looked real nice.  Considering that the boots are still new he was comfortable in them all day.  He said they are still a little stiff for driving, but he managed.  We are in the construction field so it is not like he is not  accustomed to wearing work boots...in other words its not like he is not used to having a boot around is ankle.  Probably once they break in some more he won't feel some restriction in the ankle while driving.1/27/13  We went out walking very early in the morning and the temp was only in the teens and we had snow and ice to deal with.  He wore the boots and we walked I guess about 3 miles or som about and hour, and we were moving.  I wasn't sure how comfortable he would feel using them for this purpose, but he was extremely comfortable and his feet really stayed warm.  He had no trouble walking fast.Yesterday, I cleaned them up to get rid of the mud, ice melters, etc and they cleaned up beautifully.  You can't even tell they were worn. I did get him the black.  I would imagine that the tan will stain.So...all and all he still gives these boots 5 stars and says he would even give them more if he could. I guess there is nothing else we can add to the review of these boots.  They look nice, they are comfortable and warm and if you follow the sizing information provided you shouldn't have any trouble sizing them.  Prior to ordering these we did measure his feet and then compared the measurement to the sizing chart provided and they fit.  I do see in some of the poor reviews that the fit was not good, but did they follow the sizing and fitting instructions. If you like the look of them I would say definitely give them a try.  I do see some 1 and 2 star reviews with people saying that this boot did not hold up well.  Again, he hasn't had them long so we have yet to see how they hold up long term.  He will not be wearing them everyday and would not wear them for work (he is a plumbing & heating contractor).  For that he wears his heavy duty work boots.  I would not buy the Oakley Tactical Hiking boot for a construction related trade work boot.  One man says he was using them in Afghanistan and I wouldn't think they would be hardy enough for that, but I haven't been to Afghanistan.  I would hope our military is providing these folks with the top of the line boots, but that is another subject.\", 1291: \"I've owned a pair of these previously and they were great compared to military issue boots. they survived a 10 month deployment to Iraq and about 4 months after I came home they finally broke down.

At the present moment I cannot comment on how they are in the rain or snow; however, I will update my review when I encounter that weather.The only slight criticism I have is that the fifth eyelid is made out of material and looks like it can break of the laces are pulled to tight after a period of timeIn any case I will update my review as I use them when it snows.UpdateDecember 28, 2010OK I had a chance to try them out after the snow storm passed through NJ and they kept my feet nice and warm.January 28, 2011OK with the recent two major snow storms that hit Northern New Jersey, I finally had a real chance to test out these boots. They did keep my feet warm when I had to walk in ankle deep snow.', 1293: \"Just bought a new pair of these. The last ones fell aprt after two years of hard wear and tear. Wore them trekking through Africa, to the beaches of Boracay, hiking in philippines, daily wear to work. They are very comfortable and snug even in the Middle east where i stay. The second pair just got me through two harrowing weeks of hiking both in woods and the cities of Brazil. They are waterproof but the gusseted tongue still lets water in, the seal could ahve been raised higher and like a lot of other friends who use the boots, it isn't as breathable as we'd like it to be. Our biggest problem with it though, and we use this as daily shoes, for work, outdoors, travelling, even jogging, is that the laces suck. Replaced the sedonc pair's laces with Castlebrook's Paralaces after only four months of hard use and it all worked out. I know a lot of people complain about the price, but the build quality isn't that bad. It depends on how frequently and how hard you run these shoes in.\", 1294: 'These shoes are very nice.

Stay on your head, look good on everyone who has ever tried them on, and anyone that knows anything about Oakley\\'s... know\\'s these glasses when they see them. Fakes can be made of almost any Oakley, but not these. The X-metal is an awesome strong and stylish material; and built in hinge pivot-points that join each side to the nose bridge. At first when you examine them, you may think there\\'s something slightly loose... but that\\'s how they\\'re supposed to be! They are sturdy and when you\\'re wearing them, and the pivot points and rubber shocks at the \"elbows\" aren\\'t noticeable in the least. But drop them, put them in your pocket without a case, sit on them (none of these are recommended haha), and instead of breaking or becoming misshapen they will just flex on those points. I like them better than their counterpart \"Romeo\" (larger, but similar structure), and I would take them any day over the multitude of plastic-style Oakley\\'s that I\\'ve had.  Definitely one of the best, if not the absolute best, pair of sunglasses that Oakley ever produced.', 1301: 'The quality of the optics are excellent, but Oakleys tend to have very easily damaged lenses. It doesnt take much time, even with care, before the lenses get numerous scratches that eventually become problematic. The frames are almost bombproof, however.', 1302: 'This is one of the best Oakley sunglasses,  these are my second pair, the lenses give you a better apreciation of the road. And rarely get fogged', 1303: 'I only wish I had gotten the multi=lens array set.  For the price, these are awesome.  Made in USA!!!!', 1304: \"Nice and sturdy. Worth what i paid for. It's a perfect fit with my oakley whisker.\", 1305: \"Looks cool. It is strong enough and visible enough. It's just right to protect my new shades from the bears.\", 1306: \"It does just want I need for the price. Not the hardest case but I knew that. As long as you don't accidentally sit on it worth the money.\", 1307: \"It's a little big but it works well. It keeps my glasses protected and fits in the glove box of my car.\", 1308: \"There is debate in the reviews over the size of the case. The Small Soft Vault is small and oddly shaped compared to a typical pair of glasses. This would be a poor bet if you're uncertain whether your frames will fit. However, the Oakley website specifically lists the Oakley models which fit this case.Oakley Whiskers are a snug, but perfectly comfortable, fit. Since I have no trouble getting my sunglasses in or out and closing the zipper, this ultimately means that the case takes up no more space in my bag than it absolutely needs to.The quality is perfectly fair. I wouldn't drive a car over it, but I wouldn't worry at all about dropping it or sitting on it, either. For twenty dollars, it doesn't have to last a lifetime - just long enough to save your expensive sunglasses from a few scrapes and knocks.\", 1309: 'Is an Excellent product, I received it in excellent conditions. I recommend this product for all people that wish buy it!.', 1310: \"A hard case with a full zipper. Can't go wrong.

A very smooth zippered case that protects my Oakley GasCan Sunglasses when in my backpack or other carry bag.', 1314: 'Nice case, a little big.  Replaced the smaller vault that was recently lost.  Would most likely buy the smaller again.', 1315: 'Glasses fit perfect its good for small glasses Oakley small sunglasses fit good anything bigger will not fit at all', 1316: 'the product was what I expected, totally recommend everything perfect. thank you very much for this product as good quality', 1317: 'A little pricey for just a case, but it is nice.  I keep the case in my golf bag.  It works great', 1318: 'I really like this small case. However, it fits pretty snug on my Whisker sunglasses, which are the thinnest frames Oakley offers. I could see this potentially being a problem for certain size sunglasses that are supposed to fit in these.It is just hard enough for good protection, and just soft enough to give a little when necessary.And it looks great too!', 1319: 'The quality of the case is very good, it closes with a zipper that protect the glasses. The large size is too large for thin Oakley sunglasses models as the Whisker.', 1320: 'I love this case. It\\'s roomy enough for every pair of sunglasses I own, and it protects them all very well. I like the way it doesn\\'t \"snap\" down as most cases do, because I\\'d always pinch myself or worry about crushing my sunglasses. This is a great case that I\\'d suggest to anyone.', 1321: 'this case really protects my Oakley sunglasses in my work van. It keeps them safe from being broken. Thank you for this great product.', 1322: 'Excellent case that provides plenty of protection for my Oakley Eyepatch sunglasses.  Lots of space for sunglasses and micro fiber cleaning cloth.', 1323: \"I love this case, I spend good money on my Oakley's and I love them, but I also want them protected and this case does the trick\", 1324: 'I just bought the wrong vault. I was looking for the bigger one but i dont care! this vault is awesome and i using it for my presciption glasses.', 1325: 'The case is perfect for the what I need. Durable, but not heavy, and large enough to fit many different shapes of sunglasses.', 1326: \"This is a great product; albeit, I wished I read a little closer. I *thought* this would fit the Oakley Minute 2.0 sunglasses... But it REALLY fits the Oakley Minute. The case itself is well made, not as hard of a case as I would have liked for what I need it for - but overall a great case... Once I get my Minute 2.0 sunglasses in, we'll see if it fits them or not. It may fit other glasses. I would buy a case like this again - just maybe a large size.\", 1327: 'This case is fit just right for my Oakely Whisker, should be able to protect my Whisker from drops.Happy with the buy.', 1328: 'I love everything from Oakley.  What great products and service.  This product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  It is a wonderful product and I recommend it.', 1329: 'Perfect for frogskins not to big and just the right protection. Could not say more about this great product thanks..', 1330: 'This is a nice case, just like all Oakley Vault cases. However, be warned that this case is a 55mm case, and not the large case capable of holding &#34;any&#34; Oakley sunglasses. I bought this case as an accessory for some Oakley Frogskins I bought as a gift, and the case is too small for the Frogskin glasses. The case also is too small for Oakley Oil Rigs and Plaintiffs.I just wanted to advise everyone of this, simply to save you the trouble of having to return this case for the larger version.', 1331: \"When I purchased my first pair of Oakley sunglasses, I was rather surprised that such an expensive pair of glasses didn't come with a rigid case.

My Oakley fives fit just right! Would recommend to anyone with smaller sunglass/eyeglass frames.  Happy customer!!!', 1335: \"This case is great. Fits the gas can's that I have and is pretty cool looking too.  Doesn't take up too much room either. Thanks.\", 1336: \"this case is a perfect fit for plaintiff, pit bull, & probably any Oakley product.. actually it's fine for any glasses you want to protect. don't know what you could criticize with this case. delivery is always predictable; on time or early.\", 1337: 'The case is very nicely made and will give alot of protection. My only complaint is that is was smaller then I thought it would be.', 1338: \"When I bought the sunglasses, it didn't come with a case. This case is very useful and perfect. It's a little bit big, so it will not fit into a small purse, but this case will protect the sunglasses. My husband bought it, too. We love this case.\", 1339: 'A nice case although I suspect the fabric will fray eventually after heavy wear. A large, nice looking, sturdy case.', 1340: \"I ordered these for my husband to keep his Oakley's in.  It's pretty sturdy and so far, seems to to do the job it is intended to do.  Keeps the sunglasses pretty secure.\", 1341: \"I needed a case for my new Oakley's, but I had to guess at the size. It's very high quality like most items from Oakley, but it's quite large. My glasses knock around inside of it, so I usually put them in their microfiber pouch, and then into the case. It would have been nice to have a better idea of it's size and which glasses fit well.\", 1342: \"Awesome case all around. I bought it for my Jupiter squared and can't be happier. Quality is what I expected for 25 dollars, which is really good. It fits the glasses perfectly. I also use the soft felt bag/case my Jupiter squared came in. All around its a really good case.I wouldn't use this size case for smaller glasses than the Jupiter square. The case has a larger diameter so if the glasses are small they may get tossed around.\", 1343: 'To me it seemed a bit to small. I put my black glasses in it, but was afraid to keep them in it. I have another case I use. The glasses come with a black bag that is good to put them in. I wish they had sent me a case a little bit larger. I love the Oakly Black Glasses though. I want to protect them.', 1344: 'nice case, looks good.  should protect the sunglasses good. a little bit big  but will work.  hope I have room in my glove box', 1345: 'The fit is perfect.It would be a great combo if the Oakley cleaning kit came as well.The sunglasses fit comfortably in the case without any worry that the product is getting squeezed in the case', 1346: \"It's just the right size, it's not heavy and it secures my husband's glasses safely. He loves this case and is glad he ordered it.\", 1347: 'I bought this case for my Oakley Batwolf sunglasses, and it just fit perfect. Great size and great material and great color.', 1348: 'I usually keep the case in the car and in my cargo pocket and its hit a couple of things and never had any damage to my shades. Oakley Gascans fit perfectly in this case.', 1349: 'this is the best Oakley hard case for you expesive sunglasses, good durability and good materials, excellent for the price tha you paid.', 1350: \"A little on the small side.

It definitely offers peace of mind.', 1353: 'You have to consider that these cases are designed to do only two things. They are designed to protect a valuable investment (My Oakley Blender Sunglasses) and to look good doing it. They accomplish both in style. It is a good place to keep your sunglasses so you know they are protected from being dropped or knocked around in your car or where ever else you might have them when you are not wearing them. And the Oakley name just makes them look even better to me.', 1354: 'Bought it to protect my pair of Oakley Gascan Sunglasses! It looks great and very protective. I hope it lasts.', 1355: 'I have a couple of these cases to hold multiple types of Oakley sunglasses that I own.  I have the Holbrook, Flak Jacket, and Big Taco sunglasses and all fit nicely.  Since it is a hard case, it provides good protection and since it has a zipper to keep it closed, I know that the glasses are safe when I have them packed away if I go on vacation.  I great choice for sunglasses of all different sizes!', 1356: \"Like the case.  It's a little big but a small piece of soft foam rubber solved that problem.  It's high Oakley quality.\", 1357: \"I read an earlier review on the Straight Jackets (after I placed my order) and was very concerned. Since I received my Oakleys, those concerns have been put to rest.1. These glasses are extremely comfortable.2. They fit inside my Arai helmet without interference.3. They seal tightly around my eyes and work well at speeds of up to 80MPH (haven't gone above that).4. They stay put wherever I place them on my shaved head (no matter what motion I make).5. The lenses (black iridium) really cut the glare and reduce my headaches on those sunny days.Minor con: The Grey frame is OK but I would have preferred them black.In closing, these glasses do the trick for the motorcycle rider.\", 1358: \"I lost my old pair and was looking for a new one. My old pair had always felt tight around the temples. I gave these asian fit a shot and i'm glad I did.  They fit like a glove. I'm very satisfied with them and they also look great.\", 1359: \"After tossing the idea around in my head whether I'd buy these and going to Sunglass Hut every weekend to try them on just to solidify my decision, I finally bought them!  I love them a great bit since they fit so snug, yet no tight enough to give me a roaring headache.  The polarized lenses are a huge upgrade from my non-polarized sunglasses, I can actually see stuff better especially when I am in the sun, on the water or driving.If you decide to get them make sure you shop around, I got mine on ebay for 95$ from a trusted seller.  I wouldn't have paid the price tag of 198$ at a retailer or online.  Make sure you get a hard case too.\", 1360: \"Branding is everything I guess. The glasses are lightweight, well finished, and fits well. If you like the brand, then this is a good buy. The design is not unique. Comparable products have caught up in terms of design, and for much less these days. So relative to the competition, its pricey. Came in a cloth bag, which doubles up as a cleaning cloth. For the price, one would have expected a hard protective casing to go with it. I guess it's the brand again that let's it get away with it.\", 1361: 'excellent.  great fit.  can run, bike, boat with it.  stays on and does not move around even when you are sweating.', 1362: 'It is a very good sunglasses for sports, even for the beach.I would like a better information about sizes in amazon page', 1363: \"I don't usually write reviews but something needs to be said said about the asian fit.  It rides higher on the nose bridge than regular oakleys and doesn't touch the cheek as much.  With European fit glasses it annoys me that there are streaks in the inside of the sunglasses where the eyelashes touch the lenses when they are too close to the face. No so much with this one. I also don't feel that wearing them will precipitate a migraine attack as the temple don't pinch your temples as much either.\", 1364: 'i LOVE LOVE Love these sunglasses. i wear them every day. im mad because oakly doesnt make pink glasses anymore but these are GREAT and totally worth the money.', 1365: \"The lenses are not too dark that it makes green reading difficult, yet it's shaded enough to keep the glare out. Bought this to replace the original G30 lenses which gave me a headache only after a couple of holes.\", 1366: 'Great product. Can wear in brightness or dreary day. The color is wonderful, and the polarized lenses really help with the glare.', 1367: 'Lenses are exactly as I expected.I am now filling space as it required me to in tha amazon program.', 1368: \"There's really not much else to be said about this product as everyone probably is looking to replace their scratched lenses and have prior experience with the product to begin with.  It's Oakley, it's great!  It works and fits perfectly as it is designed to do so.\", 1369: 'I was looking for lower profile replacements for my Flak Jacket XLJ lenses. Looked at the non-Oakley brand, but decided on the real deal. Replacement was easy, the lenses fit perfectly and look great.', 1370: 'These are original Oaley brand replacement lenses. They are brand new as stated and fit my Flak Jacket frames perfectly.', 1371: 'i had some scratches on my old lenses but the frames were perfect.  These lenses were well worth the money and its like having a brand new pair of glasses...', 1372: \"These are the real deal Oakley replacement lenses.  I toyed with buying the knock off lenses but decided not to due to the bad reviews of their durability.  My original lenses weren't in awful shape but they had a few scratches from several years of abuse wearing them mountain biking.  Tree branches are not kind in that regard.  Anyway these are just as good as the originals and I like the blue tint.  The lenses are darker like the original black iridiums which I was pleased with.  The photo shown makes them look lighter than they really are and look like they would offer less sun protection.  Great buy overall and much cheaper than buying all new sunglasses.\", 1373: 'Great product with all the wonderful features I love about oakley anyway.- Pure vision optic- SafetyThese are a great product.  My previous lenses lasted 3 years under hard use!', 1374: 'The lenses for in the frames perfectly. The size of the actual lens was a little smaller than I expected, but I do like them.', 1375: 'Great pair of lens and fits snugly into my old flak. now its a new flak! Good buy! Worth the wait!', 1376: 'Genuine Oakley lenses for about the cheapest I could find anywhere...perfect fit in my old frame, makes my glasses feel like new again.', 1377: 'I was very pleased with the delivery and quality of my replacement lenses!!!  I would recommendanyone that has a pair of Oakley Flak Jacket sunglasses to get a set since scratches are difficult toremove.', 1378: \"I'm super tough on my eye ware and go through lenses every eight months or so.  They are approved safety glasses and I use them as such.  A very reasonable price for the quality I would give 5 stars but there is nothing outstanding about this lens or another I already have a scratch on the left one but at least its not on my eye.  Almost time to get a new set but eye will deal with it for now.\", 1379: 'These are the real deal at the best price I can find. Amazon only stocks a few of these at a time.

Very impressed with them.', 1381: 'They are not as blue as they are in he pic.  They ate or my son for Christmas for his blue frames, but he will love them my ways.', 1382: \"needed to replace my old lenses, and these ones looked good, they fit the frames well too, hope they don't scratch to easily\", 1383: 'I must admit I was ambivalent about spending 50 bucks on these lenses, but when my originals were too scratched up after 4 years of daily use, I decided to give it a try.The old lenses popped out and new ones were installed with ease, taking just a few seconds once I got brave enough to tug on them as hard as was needed.My sunglasses are now as good as they were on the day I bought them!I may buy additional colors, as easy as they were to change out, just to have a different look from time to time.', 1384: 'Arrived in great packaging - almost over cautious with how they packed the lenses.  New lenses look great and were the right lenses for the glasses.', 1385: 'I think the price is great for a pair of authentic Oakley lenses! These lenses are great for bike riding!

The lenses are very clear and the frame fits my head perfectly. make sure you clean the lense with the case that it comes with!!!', 1389: \"I was initially hesitant to buy the Oakley Half X.  For one, no store anywhere around me carries them in stock.  We're talking about 100mi drive to the nearest dealer that had them, which simply wasn't worth it.  And when you drop $300 on glasses, you'd kind of like to make sure they fit right, and look the way you want on you.  The other problem was the only review from Country Outfitters was not good.  Well, I bought them anyway, and I'm glad I did.The pair I got from Country Outfitters was ordered on the 19th, and arrived on the 22nd.  It said it would be standard shipping, but came USPS first class, so I was really surprised when an order I placed Friday arrived on Monday.  I originally thought I was going to have to wait until next week to get these in my hands, and I kept worrying that I wouldn't like them, as I'd not seen them in person.  I was also worried about the seller, as the only review was very negative, but...I went ahead with my order.  Country Outfitters can have my business again anytime.  They shipped exactly what I ordered, far faster than I expected, and asked for far less of my money to do all of it.The quality of these glasses is very good.  The opinions I've read online seem to be either love em or hate em.  I love em.  Very stylish, I got a lot of comments on them just on the first day I had them.  Maybe because I've been wearing the Whiskers for years, but everyone seemed to really like the Half X's.  They're not as bold as some of the colored ones, and that's fine with me.  These are far more subtle and will simply be overlooked by most people who don't care to notice the details, but for anyone that has appreciation for these types of things, they definitely grab their attention with how different they are from your normal every day glasses.As far as build quality...well, my pair seems perfect.  The hinges have the right amount of tension.  The lenses are perfect.  They are symmetrical, no bending needed.  Maybe I just got lucky, not sure, but I cannot find anything wrong with them.If there was one thing I'd change about them, I'd make the lens slight shorter from top to bottom.  But I have a small head, so that's just a personal thing.  They still fit very well, just not perfectly.  I'm so glad that I don't have to tilt my head back anymore to clear the frame on my glasses when looking at my phone.  That's been bugging me for years, and these definitely solve that annoyance with the half frame.I'd buy them again, and I'd do it from Country Outfitters without any hesitation.\", 1390: 'first bought 2005 lost them 2009 - bought them again as there are no alternatives for me.very warm color - the red is incredibly strong through this glasses - colours up your life.', 1391: 'Great glasses, well wear, look great, take abuse and still hang tough.

Basically these fit great and block glare and provide UV protection. If you use these too ride a bike then these are great in the Sun but you will be blind at night. Keep in mind you still need to protect your Eyes from bugs etc. at night and cloudy days. So then for night time and cloudy days you will need clear lenses. Getting my drift?Your going to need two pairs of glasses for protection Day and Night. That may be a no Brainer but I didn't look at it this way in the beginning. So I need two pairs of Sun Glasses.

He wears them 365 days a year and they hold up against the gruesome extremes of Kansas weather, all while staying comfortable. They are his favorite pair of shoes so far, and he recommends them to everyone. They are very versatile so they are great for all types of weather and go with just about anything you'll wear (even more dressy apparel). My husband works for a family owned construction company. They work with cement, wood, metals, everything. They do everything from welding,plasma cutting, fencing, all while enduring extreme temperatures. You name it, and these shoes hold up to it. I guess that's why the military also uses them! Great buying experience, quick shipping, and saved us $$!\", 1402: \"I got this shoe for daily wear while deployed in Afghanistan, for use during PT, and while in PT clothes during down time.

Overall a good and comfortable shoe, I can run 5 miles in them and my feet are fine although it's obvious regular running shoes are better for running. I would recommend this shoe to anyone who wants a shoe that looks good and is comfortable.

I love that they cover the entire field of vision so that you do not have sun shining in from above.  They also look great and come with a neat little fabric bag that works great for preventing scratches and is low profile while they ride around in my handbag.  The lens thing that I am referring to in the title is not necessarily a flaw but may be a design feature tough I am not sure.  I have dropped the glasses twice just from waist height and each time one of the lenses has popped out. Both times it was the side that hit the floor first and each lens has done it once.Odd, but not a huge deal as the lens popped right back in both times and they are not loose in the frame or popping out at other times.  I am very satisfied overall and oakley has a great warranty on their glasses.', 1406: 'Excellent sunglasses, even after use peeled slightly, but still use the same.

They are perfect for cycling because they provide complete coverage of your eyes from the sun, wind, and rain while you ride.  The upper frame is high enough that while you are riding in the drops, you do not have any part of the frame in your field of vision.  The glasses are extremely light so that after a few minutes of riding you do not even remember you are wearing glasses.  Additionally, the arms are secure enough that they do not slide on your head regardless of how much you may sweat.Overall, a great pair of sunglasses for almost any athletic activity, especially cycling.', 1409: 'I got these as a gift for my brother and he loves them.

We just keep replacing the lens.  However, during his last business trip, the frames and all went &#34;missing.&#34;  He was devastated.  SO.  I bought these as replacement.  Might be a good idea to keep one set of frames as a back up.  On a happy note, the missing frames appeared again.  So now he has a backup pair.  These are the only sunglasses he uses.  He changes the lens per what he is doing.... yellow for night driving... dark for sun... etc. Also, should note, he has a pretty big head and these fit and stay fitting.

I have even used the yellow lenses at night with better landscape discrimination while driving.

Initially I do have some problems in fitting the lens in and I discovered that the polarized lens is slightly thicker than the non polarized lens that I had.

This is my first pair of polarized lenses and I am really pleased with how they cut down the glare when I am driving.  I bought these to replace my old chipped half jacket lenses that I've had for at least five years now.  I did choose the XLJ this time because I thought I would like the coverage better and I am glad I did.  They were fairly easy to snap out the old lenses and snap in the new ones.  It does come with helpful instructions on how to correctly take out and install the lenses.  I did struggle for a few minutes with the left lens after have no problems at all with the right one.  After a few minutes it did click in and I feel very confident that they are in there securely and no fear of them coming out accidently.  Over all, very pleased with these lenses and may go back and purchase different colors.\", 1450: \"I've had my half-jacket since 2006 and it's endured a lot of abuse.  Recently, I was in a very sandy and windy environment and, unfortunately, the finish was scratched off most of the lenses.  I was faced with either buying a new pair of Oakleys or simply replacing the lenses.I am happy that I just replaced the lenses.  My Oakleys look brand new and I spent less than half of what a new pair would have cost.  Replacing the lenses is straightforward and easy.  The lens fit was perfect.  I would recommend these replacement lenses to anyone on the fence between replacing lenses and upgrading their set of glasses.  If the frame has no damage to it, these lenses are a great call.\", 1451: 'The lenses in my Oakley Half Jacket 2.0 frames got scratched and I needed a replacement pair. I tried an off brand of lenses that were cheaper and let me just say, you get what you pay for. The off brand lenses did not fit perfectly. They were loose in the frames and within two weeks some of the tint chipped off one of the lenses. I decided to go ahead and pay the higher price and I am really glad I did. The lenses fit perfectly and the clarity is noticeably different versus the off brand lenses. These Oakley lenses are worth the money.', 1452: \"These lenses are an upgrade for me from Black Iridium.  First impressions, the lenses are darker and thicker than the Black Iridium.

Now on to Fit and Comfort, my frame is &#34;Asian Fit&#34; but these lenses still fit nonetheless.  Since these lenses are thicker, they are heavier than the Black Iridium as I could feel the extra Grams.  I thought the lenses would give me a Blueish view but it only gives a small hint of icy blue.  Overall, the lenses protect my eyes well in Bright Sunlight and the reflection off of cars' rear windows with Tints, especially Minivans and SUVs which are notorious for Razor Sharp reflection, in my opinion.\", 1453: 'Before pulling off the old lenses, take a good close look at how they fit.

I then noticed when driving the benifit was much more important.  On bright sunny days, I was able to see the road better and objects around me with more clairity.  The prior set I had I wore when climing waterfalls on vacation.  Some water and rocks hit me in the face and there were some minor cracks where they connected to the frame, but no damage to my eyes or eyesight.  Were these expensive, you bet but if they saved my eyesight and if they prevent  me from making one on the road becasue I can see better, they are worth every penny.Note: Oakley sells lenses that are specific to each frame they make.

There\\'s even a hard pouch for sunglasses to keep them from being damaged. There are 2 reason I rated his bag 4 stars instead of 5.  1st off, there is not any protection from inclement weather (ie. a rain cover).  My Lowepro slingshot bag that I use for photography has a built-in rain cover and you would think that a bag that costs as much as this Oakley bag one would include one as well.  Secondly, the metal buckle is annoyingly loud when it is not being used.  It jangles very audibly and this a distraction in class or at the library, although it is functional along with the chest strap.  My old laptop bag did not have either and it dug into my shoulders, especially when riding my motorcycle.', 1511: \"Great looking backpack. Everyone stops me and asks about it. It's large-holds everything!

I travel weekly, often on planes, and this thing looks and feels like it\\'s brand new after 18 months of abuse.  I load it up for almost every trip and it is always comfortable on my back even during long walks through airports.  It is a little large for stowage under airplane seats, but I have not yet found a seat that it will not fit under.  If it ever fails, I will most likely buy another one until someone can prove they build a superior bag.', 1513: 'I\\'ve had my eye on this bag ever since I saw it in an Oakley store in Florida.  I finally pulled the trigger and bought one.  Great construction, feels durable, and well put together.  The pockets are BIG and the inner compartments will swallow up a days worth of crap.  So why 4 stars?  It didn\\'t have as many pockets and \"hiding places.\"  Coming from a Swiss Army computer bag that seemed to have pockets everywhere, I was surprised that it outnumbered the Oakley pack by almost double.  With that said, this bag should not be thought of as a computer bag replacement.  While it may hold your laptop and ALL of your peripherals, you will find that they may not be as neatly organized due to the pocket sizes. Also the main entry flap could have been designed better.  It doesn\\'t open all the way which can restrict access somewhat.  And the pockets on the waist strap could be a little bigger.  I\\'m not sure what you would put in them--maybe lip balm, or one or two keys-- but it would be more functional if it were larger.Besides that, I don\\'t have any real complains.  The bag works.  As other reviews have mentioned, it is BIG for a back pack, but functional for daily use.Perfect for overnight trips, jobs that require you to carry small equipment, hiking, and yes, even computer use.', 1514: 'Manages to fit everything I need in it. Awesome to carry around and the waist strap is removable, because who really needs one of those right?', 1515: \"First off as always Amazon service is tip top. I ordered this pack on friday with the standard free shipping (5 to 8 buisness days it said) And it arrived on monday. The bag it's self defies words. The closest I can come is that it looks like a futuristic tactical bag. The pouches on the waist strap are the perfect size for small semiautomatic clips. And if you remove the waist strap you now have a pass through in the bag which could eazily accept a baseball bat or machete. All of this and it has room to spare. This may not be the cheapest bag on the block. But it's well worth every dime.\", 1516: \"I got this bag as a graduation gift from my brother last year. I simply loved it!!! As I got an opportunity to travel to India for a nine month research project, this bag came in very handy. There is limited space in it, except when you open up the bottom sleve. I essentially backpacked for most of the nine months carrying my DSLR camera and lens, camcoder, one or sometimes two of my laptops and about four pair of clothes and other miscellaneous items.What I love about the bag is how awesome it looks and how robust it is. Even after using it roughly for so long it still looks almost new. It is waterproof, while I was wary due to the amount of expensive electronics carried in the bag, I have been out in the rain with it and none of my things have gotten wet.While I didn't end up using the three hooks on the exterior much, mostly due to the unnessary attention it draws when you hang extra shoes or other items or other times due to the inconvenience it causes when you may bump things into people when it is crowded. But regardless, it is a great feature to have on a bag and can be used if needed.One thing to be mindful about is that when you are traveling out of country, this bag can really highlight you as a tourist. This may or may not be safe if you need to assimilate into the crowd.As for me, I have gotten a lot of compliments and curious stares when I travel with this bag... and I LOVE IT! :-)-----------------------------Update - Jan 22 2013I just thought I would update the status of my backpack now that I have used it for about two and a half years. It is still it great condition. After using it for backpacking for year as I mentioned earlier, I have been using it much more casually. In fact, it still looks pretty new. The only wear that I see is in the separator of compartments inside the bag. There is a minor tear on the side of this separator and I just I have adjust it a bit to make sure it doesn't in the way when zipping up the laptop compartment. Other than way, I can't hardly see any wear and tear on the backpack!\", 1517: 'First I will say I got my bag through Oakley Standard Issue website for $99 so it was a great deal. I travel a lot for business, mainly 3-4 day trips and since I got this bag I no longer check bags for travel. I am writing this review while I am sitting in the Hotel filling it back up getting ready to fly back home. For this 3 day trip I packed in:My Dell E6510 15.6\", charging cable, Ipad with charger, Bose headset (fits perfect in the sunglass holder on top), Dress pants, dress shirt, running shoes, baseball hat, 5xT-shirts, 3 pairs of socks, 2 boxershorts, 16 CD\\'s, 16 3x5 pocket guides about 1/4inch thick each, magazine, Oakley glasses, My trusty travel coffee mug, and a small bag with travel approved bodywash, toothpaste, facewash, toothbrush, deoderant and electric razor.I actually had room for an extra shirt and shotglass I picked up at the local Harley shop and still have a little room.It\\'s heavy but it works.', 1518: \"I've had my eye on this bag since it was first released. I loved how big it was with so many compartments for everything. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband who has a 17 inch laptop and travels a great deal for work. I figured it would be big enough for the computer, plus his carry on items.The bag is great! Really big with lots of space for clothing, books, cameras and so on. However, the laptop pocket was not big enough to fit my husbands laptop in. He has a MSI that is quite high tech and thick, so I am guessing its because of the size of the laptop rather then the design of the backpack.I contemplated keeping the bag for myself, since my 15.2 laptop fit in just fine.

But even amongst these models, there is a difference between the Asian fit and regular fit.

In fact, I would suggest it to anyone who does not have narrow oval face. I used it for a long drive from west coast to east coast. Great for the bright sunlight and comfortable even when the light fades. The only negative that I can say is that it is a bit tight and the side of the ear starts to pain after like 4-5 hours.

Overall, I\\'m very happy with the glasses and at $157 instead of the usual $260 on Amazon, I\\'m a happy camper.I am aware that the deal may be too good to be true but everything about the glasses say they are authentic from the raised \"O\" logo, color is jet black, made sure they are polarized (I can barely see the computer screen when I have the glasses on) and they look and feel exactly like my dad\\'s who bought his for $260 on Amazon. However, it did have a tiny, fancy little P sticker on the glasses which is the only reason why I have doubts about its authenticity since Oakley glasses are not supposed have stickers on them. I\\'ll go to an Oakley store to get them appraised but in the meantime, this customer is satisfied!Edit: November 5I found the \"sticker\" that I was talking about earlier.

At first I was concerned the oakley frame might be a bit to orange for my taste, but when they arrived the tortoise shell was a darker brown/copper(with gold oakley symbol) that I really like. Unlike the Scalpel Oakleys I have, the Monsterdogs have no rubberized grips anywhere on the glasses, I have yet to go out and \"be active\" with the monsterdogs but regardless of this the way they fit feels very comfortable and firm. And i don\\'t worry about them falling off. Plus seeing the world through copper lenses is nice.

It was the same one that I had before, so I would give this product 5 stars.', 1563: \"I wear Oakley sunglasses and they come with these microfiber storage bags and I bought two extras to use for other glasses as well.  They close with a drawstring and do keep them clean. I especially like these because I always have something to clean/wipe the glasses with and don't have to carry a separate cloth.

While it was fine as a case, the material was different and didn't do an effective job of cleaning the glasses.

They're light but very sturdy and they fit great (order a 1/2 size above was great advice from one of the previous reviewers). So why 4 stars?

I was a bit skeptical because they're not really a shoe company, but they designed these well.The spikes they come with are a pretty big upgrade from my decade-old Dexters, both in terms of performance and ease of upgrading. They just use the same spikes that are now standard, so you can buy pretty much any leading set.The shoe is not the most comfortable, but it is comfortable. Certainly more than any other shoe in it's price range. I've tried some FootJoy's on that cost twice as much that I would say are more comfortable, but overall I'm happy saving a Benjamin.The construction feels solid. They give you real shoestrings in stead of those thin laces a lot of golf shoes come with. They're sufficiently long to tie in a double not, but not so long that you're then tripping over them.All in all I'm a pretty big fan. They're as good as most shoes that cost 50% more.\", 1606: 'Item really majestic quality and very comfortable.the numbering is perfect and a bold style.

I'm curious to see how they will hold up through the fall and winter months.\", 1608: \"The boot is light weight, blends well with the dust and wears like a tennis shoe.  It is comfortable and not too high on that it gets hot.  I've yet to test it with water and it could use a few holes to allow your feet to breathe.  In short, I will say, I made the best choice selecting this shoe; however, I would like to see a future boot with a few holes to allow the feet to breathe and some weather silicone so the shoes are weather proof.\", 1609: \"These boots were a gift for my son, and he loves them.

I had to do that with a pair of sketchers boots as well. That might be a boot thing. I actually have an Oakley store in my area so I got to try them on whice was a plus. As for the boots themselves, they\\'re quite comfortable. The heel feels fine if you get the right size. The boots feel supportive, especially in the ankle area. The quality of the outside is quite good as well. I did notice some very small traces of left over glue run off on some parts of the sole. It\\'s dosen\\'t detract from the style, but I was expecting a flawless example. Might just be mine. The other reviewer complained about the boots being loose at the ankles. I\\'ve found that when you take them off, it natually expands the boot opening. So when you put them back on and tighten them, I\\'ve found that you should tighten the laces about 3 eyelets down first, then thighten the top laces like a normal shoe. It\\'s easy and takes only a few seconds more to tie the boot. From the description, i was afraid of the suede upper, but it\\'s actually hard and more rubber like that cleaning them or polishing them wont be a problem. Also, the back of the boot with the Oakley \"O\" symbol is a hard plastic or rubber. It\\'s actually good because it\\'s kinda like heel armor. Overall, these are very nice boots, they\\'re comfy if you get the right size and the style factor is a major plus.', 1612: \"I've had them since Aug of last year and they are still going on strong they where with me in Afghanistan i recommend you get thick sock during cold season.because they don't keep the cold out.\", 1613: 'Just recieved these today and I love them. They are so comfortable!!! As soon as I put them on and stood up, I felt like my posture improved. I bought them primarily for winter wear to keep my feet warm and dry and they certainly do that.

If you want a good comfortable hiking boot, this is the one.', 1614: 'I dont write reviews about anything ever.  So when I tell you these boots rock please believe me.

Only slight issue is that if you are a 10.5, they are a tad snug at first on the sides.', 1616: \"Right out of the box these boots felt extremely comfortable. This was my main concern as I had no time to break in a new pair of boots with a quickly upcoming deployment. Having spoken to many of my Army buddies who have been to the desert, Oakley's boots had come highly recommended, for the hiking boots and the combat boots. I trusted my experienced soldier buddies and purchased these based upon extended research about the sizes, fitting, weight, availability, and cost.Here are my pros and cons:PROS:* ComfortNO break in period. These boots were comfy and well fitting right out of the box. There were no issues with pressure points on my feet from the internal construction. These felt more like sneakers than your typical stiff soled hiking boots.* ConstructionThe material is very durable yet supple suede. The large fabric sections on the boots allow for easy breathing, yet the padding helps insulate, keeping my feet, which are exposed to 120+ temperatures, relatively cool. I wear these boots for 14-18 hours a day. The boots are also very lightweight making it easier to move my feet fast enough if I have to run and easier to tread terrain with heavy cargo on my back. The non-marking sole is also designed aggressively enough to handle extreme terrain, yet feel comfortable as a sneaker on flat pavement/indoor floors.*  PerformanceI've had 50+ lbs on my back wearing these shoes and the tread didn't wiggle or squirm (a HUGE thing for me). I've walked easily and confidently on various terrain from dirt, mud, sand, small rocks and large. The tread moves comfortably over rocks slightly conforming to the terrain, yet not overly so (squishy) or under conforming (sliding, scooting rocks which would cause loss of grip).CONS:* The ONLY gripe I have is about the shoes laces, which are very durable but they come undone fairly often. Fortunately, this is easily and cheaply remedied with another set of laces.If you've made it this far through my review, I hope you purchase these boots and are as enthusiastic  about  them and as satisfied with them as I am.\", 1617: \"Got this pair of boots for hiking and they're great. They look great for casual wear and are extremely comfortable. Most shoes need a break in period but these felt comfortable on the first day I wore them and I had them on all day. I may probably get another pair just for daily use while I use this pair for hiking only.\", 1618: \"I tracked this item for slightly over a year, I couldn't find it cheaper then $100.000, I really liked it and all the reviews I read about it were highly apprising it.Until I finally found it on Amazon Warehouse Deals, but it was tagged as used but described as in mint condition, I thought that was not a bad deal, even though I'm completely against buying any used clothes.When I received the item it was brand new with all the wrappings and the tags in the original box, no signs for even trying it in the store or anything, the only thing was it had few blemishes one would find on any new shoes on a store shelf, which i easily wiped off.It looked like an imprint form the ink on the box, my guessing it was weather a floor model in a store, or sat too long against its box leaving these ink marks.Excellent buy, and I'm more than happy with it.\", 1619: 'I am buying another pair , this will be my 3rd pair ... I wore these when i was deployed in the philippines and afghanistan. I can not say enough good things about these shoes ... I will always wear these until they decide not to make them anymore ...', 1620: 'I USE THESE IN AFGHANISTAN AND THEY ARE GREAT SHOES BUT THEY TEND TO WEAR OUT EASILY AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS OF USE. THEY ARE GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. WRITTEN BY SPECIAL FORCES MEMBER.', 1621: \"Plainly put, this boot is comfortable, rugged and well designed. I use this boot for work in mainly outdoor environments on all types of surfaces. It has held together and gotten me through long 12-14 hour days. As with any shoe, the soles wear down, but this boot has lasted longer than any other boot I've owned. Oakley has always been expensive, but of a higher quality, so I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates getting what they pay for.\", 1622: 'Really comfortable and it seens it will last.True to size, and incredibly lightweight. I always get oakley boots .s', 1623: 'I bought them in black suede. Nice looking, super comfortable and seem sturdy...I am pretty rough on my boots so time will be the judge of how sturdy.

Gracias', 1625: 'I bought these over a year ago for my work in Afghanistan and Iraq.  They are MUCH cooler and lighter than the Belleville boots I was issued.  The sole has not worn too much (although there is no pavement around here to wear them down on), no holes or anything either.  The only problem that is starting to develop is that the laces are cutting through the cloth lace loops.  I think metal eyelets would have been better.  But I would still buy another pair if needed.', 1626: 'The boot is lightweight and comfortable and provides good support.  (I am a big guy.) I took the written advice and ordered 1/2 size larger (11.5 instead of 11.0) and the fit with my medium weight hiking socks is perfect. I wore them in the desert in the UAE where they performed as I had hoped.

It has been about 2+ months and they are great.  Very comfortable, like walking on clouds.I have used them just about everyday working on a cattle farm and they are holding up well.', 1630: 'I bought this shoe about two years ago from oakley.com for about 100 dollars free shipping. It is very comfortable. I work in muddy cold environment and this shoe protected me and keep my feet feels dry, worm, and very comfortable.', 1631: 'This boot is something great to have. It feels great on the foot after long wearing, and it is something that I would recommend!', 1632: \"Yes, these shoes are a pretty penny, and I took a gamble buying these online not having the opportunity to test the correct size. I made an educated guess and took the previous reviews with a grain of salt. I felt comfortable with my typical shoe size 8. So, I ordered the size 8. I could not be happier with this shoe. All around comfort and it fits snug, for this 5'3 leprechaun.\", 1633: \"I really like these shoes.  I work in a very hot climate that has somewhat rocky and sandy terrain.  Regular boots were just too heavy and hot.  I wanted something light, comfortable, and durable. The Sabot Low has met my needs perfectly.  I've been wearing them now for two months, and they've worked out very well.  The souls are tough and durable but without making the shoe heavy.  The sizing seems pretty true.  I normally wear 11.5 or 12s in shoes depending on brand and style.  I ordered a size 12 and they fit fine on me...comfortably snug.  I definitely recommend these shoes.\", 1634: \"Never knew Oakley even made shoes, but I was looking for a very specific set of features in a shoe and the Sabot low was the only thing I found that came close.  I wanted a low cut hiking shoe with breathability, but not mesh.  Here in San Diego there's these grasses called foxtails that have horrible seeds that will penetrate ANY type of open mesh as found on most vented hikers.  You either have to get an all leather shoe and have your feet be really hot or suffer the foxtails.  These seem to be pretty good so far, the vent material is Cordura which is tightly woven enough to prevent the foxtails from burrowing in to them, while being cooler than an all leather shoe.  They're not waterproof, but in SoCal that's not as important for me.Anyways, so far they're fairly comfortable.  The laces are too small dia and the top eyelet could use a second one that's not so far back, but it's manageable.  Size seems about dead on for me, I'm a 12 and tried a 12.5 based on other reviews but they were too big so I exchanged them for a 12.  Heel is pretty stable, doesn't slip too badly.  Only thing looks-wise is the finish on either side of the tongue opening- it's rough cut and not finished at all... it looks cheap but doesn't really take away from the performance of the shoe at all.  If you get them directly from the Oakley.com store they have a 45day money-back guarantee, and a 90 warranty on top of that.  Most of their stuff seems geared towards a military user, so hopefully they end up lasting a while...\", 1635: \"Use these for shooting and when I am going to be on my feet a lot. The amount of money for them are kind of a minus but once you get them they will surprise you. Very comfortable and great air circulation through the entire shoe. If you are on the fence of these shoes buy them and you won't be disappointed.\", 1636: 'Great fit and comfort.  Wear the shoe for work about three times a week.  I live in a hot weather climate year around (Hawaii) and feet stay cool.  Somewhat water resistant and in light rain or walking through puddles, feet stay dry.  Love the shoe and will probably buy another pair.', 1637: 'Decent shoes.  They\\'re a little stiff so if you are going to go hiking with them, you\\'ll need a \"breaking-in\" period.  I got them about 10 days before my trip and I was glad I did.  I wore them everyday to get them comfortable before I left.  Also, they ran a half size small for me.  I normally wear a 10 but had to return them for 10.5.  Just a heads-up.  Overall a solid shoe and comfortable once you break them in.', 1638: 'Reasons I like this pair of shoes.My doctor recommended that I get shoes with arch support and when I tested a pair of this shoes it felt great.  The support was there and the softness of the sole as well.  Besides needing arch support I also need soft soles since I have bone spurs at the bottom of my feet and after wearing this for one day but my feet felt fine.  I also like that it is all black or all beige.  It helps being able to match it with my work clothes and no one notices that I am not wearing business shoes.Wishlist.I would buy another pair if they cost less.', 1639: \"I am in a very hot, rocky terrain - very dusty also. These shoes saved me! The soul is supportive and thick enough without being heavy or restricting. I like the Sabot Low especially because it's a shoe and not a boot. The color is perfect for dusty climate. It never looks dirty and cleans very easily by running briefly under water. The hot dry climate dries it off completely in less than 2 hours. I can not say enough - I highly recommend them!\", 1640: \"Love the fit and the feel of these.  I previously had the Oakley Half Wire 2.0.  Those would get a little heavy after an extended period of wear.  These are much lighter, but there's no sacrifice of clarity.  I would highly recommend these sunglasses\", 1641: 'My husband and I both have these. I have the female version of coarse. Great for driving in any weather. I get headaches and migraines a lot, and these are wonderful for preventing those while driving.', 1642: \"Love Oakleys, these are my 11th pair.  Had a little trouble with this particular pair, more specifically when flipping the over on a flat surface they didn't lay flat on a table which in turn means they sat slightly crooked on the face.  I had to send them back to Oakley at my expense, and the pair they sent back didn't fix the problem, so the associate on the help line had me take out the lenses to see if the frame was crooked, and when we did, we discovered the frame is fine and the lenses were causing the glasses to be crooked.  Needless to say oakley is paying to ship back the lenses and send me a new pair which will hopefully fix the issue.  Given that I got them at less than half of what Sunglass hut was charging, I'm ok with a little hassle.  Other than that the clarity and everything else I expect from Oakley was great.\", 1643: 'I got what I was expecting. Great looking sunglasses: Lightweight, color of the frame, color of the lens, comfortable, stylish.', 1644: 'Good sun glasses. I use them for fishing and driving. The only thing is they are expensive.  I hafd them for about 2 years and now there are some marks and discoloration on lense. Also ruber broke on handles.', 1645: 'Nice shades. The frames are an excellent fit and the amber tint increases viability while being easy on the eyes in bright daylight.  Recommend.', 1646: 'Over all fit, form and function are great.

I started off with the cheap versions that you pick up at convenience stores, etc... finally moving up to more expensive brands after realizing I spent over $100/year on the cheapies.  I have been an Oakley fan for over 10 years and have owned +/- 15 pairs including XX, Romeo, Gascan, Zero, etc...  I currently only have a pair of Spike polarized metal framed glasses and now these Hijinx.  All of the Oakleys I've owned have been beautifully crafted and durable. Generally Oakley sunglasses have lasted me a year or more. These Hijinx are cleanly styled but not outlandish.  I have a larger face and like to have large sized sunglasses, these are fairly large. I generally like to have the soft rubber nosepiece which these don't have, but that's something I knew beforehand.  The main reason I purchased these is the great price and next day local express delivery in Indianapolis.  I ordered them technically on the 11th of May and received them same day ( I completed the order must after midnight and had these in hand by 2pm).  Amazon Prime for students is awesome!\", 1653: 'I bought this replacements for my oakleys hijinx sunglasses and they came perfect and fitted nicely.

They are big enough for my husband's larger round face but also look nice on my more petite face. In fact I wear them now having taken them over from him. The wide sides block the sun from coming in from the side of my eye when driving perpendicular to the sun. It eliminates the need to move the sun shade over to the driver side window to block the sun.\", 1656: 'This glasses are really good! I love the color, the fitting, the shape... They just feel good when you wear them!', 1657: \"I've had the exact same pair but in black for over a year and love them.

The reason I'm giving a four is due to the fact that in the picture a brown bag is shown. However when I received my sunglasses today they came in a black bag. Not a big deal, but if they come with a black bag a black bag should be shown.\", 1660: 'The glasses are great for people that like a larger fitting frame. Style is great and lenses are dark. Always have had Oakley sunglasses and these are now my favorites.', 1661: \"I bought these glasses as a replacement for ones my husband had gotten scratched up (which also got lost a week later).  I figured they'd be decent since they were Oakleys, but they were even nicer than I had anticipated when I got them.  My husband LOVES these glasses.  They're sturdy and look cool too.

My eyes were watering from the pain but my Oakley's...perfectly fine.I have a medium-wide face and they fit perfectly.  On a boat or in a convertible the wind never once bothers my eyes.  The only thing is I wish I had coughed up the extra $70 for the polarized.  I live in Florida and spend a decent amount of time at the beach or on lakes and the polarized would be nice for contrast on the water (you never know about sharks or gators).\", 1681: 'This is one of the sunglasses I like the most, they are very comfortable and durable, I recommend this a lot!', 1682: 'Best thing i ever bought my son he is very happy with these glasses will definetly think about other family members when gift times come around. thank you Stacey', 1683: 'Great.

I have a medium to a large size head so they fit me great. I look forward to ordering the Matte Black finish in these as well. Two thumbs up to the seller!!Edit 9/17/2011 These glasses are still like new, im sure its not just the product but when you pay such money for such normal cheap accessories you actually take care of it. The quality is really noticed after 3 months of everyday use on and off the pop when unfolding the ear pieces is still there. The lenses are as clear as day without any scratches.', 1685: 'so i bought these bout a month ago, great glasses! very clear lenses and very wide view. dont ever see the frame at all. the only problem i had with them was that they were a little big and the polished plastic frame makes them a little slippery.i have a smaller and narrower sized head so they tended to slide off a little when i looked down. to fix this i used a sort of grip/rubber tape that i wrapped around the last inch or so of the sides and now they stick great! fit very comfortably and always stay in place. all in all, great buy. very nice sunglasses and they look great', 1686: 'Lost my first pair and it upset me quite a bit.  Bought this one which is a bit different from my first pair, but I like the oil rig design.  Great for my bigger than normal size head...lol.', 1687: \"Had my brother purchase these for me. The description says polished black frame/black lens, but they are actually the black frame with ghost silver text/black iridium lens.  For $100, I can't imagine owning anything better.  Not only do they look superb and totally bad-a$$ on me, but the clarity and field of vision is unlike anything I've owned before.  This is my first pair of Oakley's, so I only have cheap sunglasses to compare them to, but I don't think I'll ever regret this purchase.  Also, these come new in the box with the brown HDO microfiber sleeve that can be used to clean them.  If you're thinking about it, and you have a medium to large face, don't hesitate to get them at all.  I have a medium face, and the only thing I can find even remotely wrong is that they don't exactly grip my face, so rugged sports while wearing them probably wouldn't be the best idea.  Maybe if I had a larger face, they would grip better, but I wouldn't risk damaging these by exerting while wearing them anyways.  I've read the Monster Dogs are much better for activities and overall contour grip, but I couldn't get over the style of these...so I'm completely happy now lol.\", 1688: 'Lenses were just what they were said to be and fit perfect. Shipping was prompt, got them for a good price too these lenses are hard to find in any stores.', 1689: 'These are the Inmate Polarized in Brushed Chrome Frame and Light Black/Dark Gray lenses which, Denzel Washington wore during the entire duration of his movie \"The Book Of Eli\", and through which, the movie was depicted. The effect was that eerie darkened and grayed ambiance putatively depicting  life after the great gloom.The lenses are extra dark, allowing only about 15% of light to pass and the polarization cuts 99% of the glare. It is recommended for the ultra sunny summer days where the eyes should be protected against the harmful spectrum of  sunlight and the annoying bright day glare.The glasses have a very symmetric design as well as understated character, giving them appeal to mature men with a strong sense of self awareness, and a very masculine outlook. They are not for the faint-hearted or the flamboyant type. Even women who normally prefer men\\'s glasses will not be found sharing them with their men; they are simply too masculine to pass for unisex.surprisingly, These glasses are very comfy to wear all day long even though Oakley describes them as Racing Eyewear , meaning very tight and they stick to your face; literally. Only be very careful putting them on in a hurry; the straight arms have a love affair with eye pupils; they tend to look for and poke your eye  as an expression of that love!All in all, if you like the Oakley brand but could not find an understated model, these should satisfy the most discerning men who are looking for a subtle statement of strength and self confidence, and full eye protection.5-Star for design, 5-Star for appeal, 5-star for functionality, 5-Star for esoterics, 5-Star for material,  and 5-Star for bang for the buck .', 1690: \"These Oakley's are perfect for sports.  They have little vent holes on the lenses that keep them from fogging.  They snug against the temples and nose and don't move in place even if you're running or bouncing.

No complaints at all.\", 1691: \"I wear these every day to and from work, in the yard, watching and playing softball...they are very nice and surprisingly light.  Of course, the Braves are my team as well.  Wish they didn't cost as much but it is what it is.\", 1692: \"I've been wearing these sunglasses for around 6 months now and enjoy them all the time.

Second pair I have owned. Amazing clarity and love the matte black frames. Very happy with purchase', 1704: 'I used to own a smaller pair of Oakleys.  However, my daughter dropped and scratched one of the lenses and over time more and more of the coating on the lens has worn off.The new Straight Jacket has been going strong for almost a year now.  Not a single scratch after daily use.  The frame is also a little larger than some older models giving better eye coverage and not allowing as much sunlight in from the top and bottom.  The sides are also thicker and more supportive, thus minimizing any movement when wearing them.The only con I have is because of the curve nature of this style and the thicker sides, it almost does not fit in the pop-open sunglass holder in the ceiling of my car.  By almost I mean as you close the holder the frame hits the top, but with a gentle push the sunglass frame gives just slightly enough to allow the holder to close completely.', 1705: 'I purchased these as a gift for my boyfriend .

The polarized lenses are worth every penny.', 1709: \"Well, they are Okaley's, so you know they are quality. They fit well and look sharp. The cost little more to be polarized, but it's worth it if you are going to be looking at a lot of snow.\", 1710: \"These are probably my second favorite sunglasses with my pair of Ray-Ban 3212 being number one. I bought these on a cruise for 180 a while back and when I first got them I was was looking around outside and didn't really see anything great, so I took them off and I was stunned how bright everything was, and how there was massive amounts of glare everywhere stopping me from seeing almost everything. Overall I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting a all round pair of sports glasses. If price is a issue then I would go with something else like the Half Jackets.\", 1711: 'I really thought Oakley was more about fashion than substance, but have really liked these.  They fit great and stay on my (bald) head even when sweating.', 1712: 'These are very good sunglasses. Have very good style. Perfect for medium face. A good buy for those looking for protection from the sun and style.', 1713: \"I wear my glasses from morning until dusk almost everyday, rain, shine, cloud, snow, ice, water, etc. I have a real sensitivity to glare that give me bad headaches. The brown lenses help a ton on their own and the polarization is a life saver. The color and contrast enhancements make a huge difference. I find the brown/root beer lens works so much better all around compared to the gray lens. The original root beer lens on the frog skin glasses from the early 90's was the best. This brown lens is almost as good. The color is different in the newer material. I had a pair of half jackets that I loved too. But with as much shooting as I do I needed A full frame lens for safety. It was strange getting used to the bottom frame after having worn my gargoyles and half jackets for 20+ years. But there are no other glasses that I would want to own or wear. My wallet, keys and my Oakley's go everywhere with me every time. No exceptions. I can't imagine going outside without them. They are pricey but for me you never skimp on eyewear or any other essential gear.Year round these are a must for me. I wouldn't trust my eyes to any other brand.\", 1714: 'These are great sunglasses.  The polarized lenses let me see right through water, and reduce the glare of everything.  These are also very tough glasses, which are able to stand up to my 2 years old girl.', 1715: 'Great glasses probably my favorite pair! I did scratch the Lenses the first time I wore them but was able to find a replacement on ebay.', 1716: 'This is one my favorite Oakley sunglasses since it fit me well. The lens color make everything looks so awesome especially in fall and winter. My first pair is black and this is my second pair with brown (rootbeer) color frame. Highly recommended for small face like me.', 1717: 'I decided to step up to a nice pair of glasses after realizing wearing scratched and ill-fitting $10 glasses was causing me more harm than it was worth.  After looking around, I settled on Oakley because I could visit an Oakley vault and try them on and because Oakley seemed to have the best warranty.The Straight Jackets are a nice no-frills pair of glasses.  I have a large (wide) head and the straight jackets were one of the few glasses that fit me comfortably in the store.  This pair (matte black/grey polarized) are not very attention getting or flashy.  In fact, I liked them because there is no reflective surface which allows me to wear them hiking and hunting without worrying about scaring game with an ill timed glint.  The optical clarity and polarization are superb and worth the money.  The pair I received were a little too tight (narrow) out of the box but are now (about 1 month later) very comfortable.  I can only assume the plastic in the bridge of the nose stretched a little due to the constant tension of me wearing them.I like these so much I am thinking about getting a pair in stealth camo or ice with mirrored lenses for wearing out on the town and keeping these as a work/play pair.', 1718: 'The ONLY thing that I found not to like was using a cord with them, while wearing a ball cap, at the beach. For whatever reason the cord and cap always caused the glasses to ride up towards my forehead and I continually had to adjust them. Yes, I know it sounds strange. Other than that very picky issue these are excellent sunglasses.', 1719: 'These fit great and I love how light they are.  I would highly recommend to anyone who likes polarized/Oakley sunglasses.', 1720: 'This a great sport watch that is very high quality and looks great for any occasion. It keeps precise time and is very comfortable to wear. Great job Oakley!!!!', 1721: \"I've had my watch now for 9 months. It's my go-to watch. I get compliments on it all the time. It works, looks and feels perfect. It's solid. I wish they had the same style with different face colors for my second one. Im thinking of buying another one to have it on hand.\", 1722: 'I chose this rating because my Oakley gives me good service, quite attractive and looks well on my tan bodyI do not dislike anything about this lovely watch,I would recommend this watch to anyone who has good taste, good sense of style, and wants reliable time and date', 1723: \"My favorite timepiece. I get comments on this watch frquently. Very good quality and don't see any reason why I won't get years of great use from it.\", 1724: 'received on time and as described. new and original packaging.  looks great and easy to change the band (allen key needed). price when buying, was the cheapest around for this style.', 1725: 'I have many watches (collect them). I have owned this watch for about a year now, COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH IT. Stands out (in a good way) anywhere with any outfit. Out of all of my time-pieces this is probably my favorite. It is a big watch, so make sure to look at the size before you make your decision. No doubt a quality classic....', 1726: 'This is an awesome watch. This is definitely an Oakley high quality item. It features a sapphire crystal that is scratch resisitant, brushed steel case, and a quality swiss movement with 13 jewels. This watch keeps precise time and I have not had to replace the 48 month battery yet.', 1727: \"Oakley's Judge II Dual Time displays one timezone on the main dial, and a different one on the subdial.  Frequent travellers, people who routinely coordinate with people in other timezones, people seperated from those they love by timezones all can use a time piece that allows they to see two different timezones at a glance.  Seperate stems for setting the timezones simplify the mechanism, without making the appearence excessively 'busy'.The styling is the acme of Oakley styling, striking a balance between avant garde, and austere.  The dial is easily read, with the date at the 12 O'clock position and simple hands and index markings.  The subdial, the second timezone, adds 3,6, & 9 numbers, but preserves the overall readibility.  The contouring of the bracelet is dramatic, and makes the watch rather heavy, but doesn't snag, and has a complex aesthetic.  With mechanical and biological influences, it is easily recognizable, comfortable (if you're OK with the weight), and distinctive.  The styling won't appeal to everyone, but I like it.The price is too high.  If they'd bring this into the $300-$500 range, I could get behind it, but the MSRP over $800 is not reasonable for even a Swiss quartz watch from a company that doesn't specialize in watches.  This alone lost it a star, and nearly lost it two stars.A striking and practical watch if you like a watch with serious weight, but a little pricey.E. M. Van Court\", 1728: 'Stylish watch at a great price.  Very durable for work and play.  Like the high visibility orange dial.  The watch band is also very comfortable playing sports including golf.', 1729: \"I've had my watch for about a month now and I love it! This is my first Oakley watch and I couldn't be more pleased. I love the way it looks and the way it feels on my wrist. I will caution anyone considering this watch: it's no lightweight. Some people don't like heavy watches. If you are one of those people, this is probably not the watch for you. As for the service, the watch was accurately described and priced at or below any other seller here or on eBay. I received my watch within the time stated after the purchase and it was in perfect condition. I did not have any need to contact the seller.\", 1730: 'Excellent product the watch is just what i expect not too big not too small, totally worth for the price great watch', 1731: \"I bought this watch as a birthday gift for my husband.  I had high expectations because of the brand, but was leery because of the low cost.It is a well made and durable watch.  The band adjustment is just okay though.  You have to take out rather large pieces which make it too large or small.  Then you have to hope that the smaller adjustment near the clasp will bring it to the correct size.  Also, if you have to move the smaller adjustment to be larger it leaves a strange looking spacing.We had another issue as well.  However this one is not necessarily due to manufacturing.  It's more of a color problem.  It is difficult to read the time due to the similar color of the face and hands.Besides those minor flaws my husband seems happy with this middle of the road watch.\", 1732: \"I chose the rating of 5 stars because the watch is great, and very stylish, and I based it on the watch alone.  However, when I received it, the battery was dead so I had to get a new one put in.  But it isn't just a simple take it in, wait and they pop a new one in.  You have to take Oakley watches to an Authorized Oakley Jeweler and they either keep it there for a couple days or they send it out because it has to be professionally done because there are performance checks that they do and then it is re-sealed.  It took 4 days to get back.  It isn't a big deal to do that, since I have done it before with my other Oakley watches, the problem is, I don't expect to buy a brand-new watch with a dead battery!  Never do it yourself because it will void any warranty.\", 1733: \"I have had this frames for over a year now and it hasn't dissapointed me.  I sat on my frames the other day and I was surprised that when I tried to put them back in place (even though they were completely out of shape) the weldings didn't snap.I'm very happy with them, this is my 7th pair of Oakleys so far and I have always either lost them or scratch the lenses, never broke them. In the other hand the nose pads are not durable at all.  I have changed them once already and I have to do it again now.\", 1734: 'I got this at half the original price.  Excellent condition.Caution to oakley buyers though.  Make sure you get the right frame size.  This particular model is not suited for those with big heads and is a little heavy.', 1735: \"I needed a pair of glasses to combat being at a computer for 12-15 hours a day. This is my first pair of glasses and I tried many frames. I wanted something very light that I wouldn't even notice was on. I also wanted them to be comfortable both behind my ears and on my nose for extended periods of time.After trying about 20+ frames, I settled on these and I am very happy with them. They look great, hold up well to being bent, and are extremely comfortable. I'm already finding myself unable to feel that they are on. They have the really solid construction that I've come to expect and love from Oakley. For someone with minimalistic tastes like me, you can't go wrong with these frames!\", 1736: 'I got these prescription glasses for my workplace and I have to say they\\'re nice. The design is an interesting mix of a retro look with futuristic materials: the \"pewter\" is Oakley\\'s custom alloy in a flat silver color that gets people\\'s attention without having to be shiny to do it. They make me look pretty professional, but most importantly they are lightweight, easy to adjust, and seem to be hard to bend out of shape. It\\'s a weird contradiction: how can something be pliable by your hands, but still stiff enough to not get bent out of whack with regular use?I don\\'t know how Oakley manages it with their materials, but this classy look is also strong and lightweight.', 1737: 'Very happy with my purchase. Packaged extremely well. Very easy to pop into place. Received plenty of compliments on the Iridium (Fire) color. High quality from Oakley as always.', 1738: 'My old gascan lenses were chipped causing my vision to be obstructed. These were easy to pop in and work well. They are a little darker than most lenses, but that works.', 1739: \"The fact that the old (scratched and pitted) lenses popped right out and these new ones popped right in is a terrific feature. The new lenses are identical to the originals as far as look and fit goes. The Black Iridium has a mirror look but is more see-thru that pure mirrored lenses. They look sharp and function well. Couldn't be happier.\", 1740: \"I'm really impressed on how great these replacement lenses are. I was expecting the lenses to have a slightly different shade but it was perfectly the same as my original Gascan. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. If you have scratched lenses like I did, then this one would definitely be a good buy.\", 1741: 'It is an excellent product, very nice and it serves me for what he needed, my need was this product and it seems to me to be very good, thank you.', 1742: 'The lenses are great although the pictures shows a matte like finsh of emerald green, but when light hits the lenses, it does change different colors, still nice.', 1743: \"I ordered the bronze lenses for my polarized gascan glasses, and I noticed the description of the individual item differs from the main description; notably whether or not the individual lens options available are polarized.Mine were not polarized and I'm ok with that, but I can see how the title may be misleading.\", 1744: 'great tint, especially in flat light, but any condition is awesome in these lenses.. I used to use polarized exclusivly, but titanium is awesome for those situations where polarized is not nessessary', 1745: 'First polarized lenses... i feel like i just entered a whole different world were everything is 50 times clearer! so good i bought 2 pairs! just in case :P', 1746: 'These lenses give the Oakley Gascan frame an aggressive look, and are optically perfect. I have been wearing these off and on for approximately one month. Compared to the non-iridium gray lenses that came with my glasses, these block a little more light and have a reflective surface. These lenses are redder than the iridium fire (which to my eye have a yellower, sometimes almost green hue from certain angles), and in my opinion have a more sophisticated look. They insert very easily into the frame, with very little &#34;flinch factor&#34; (i.e. one does not feel as if they will break, or the frame will be damaged). Once inserted properly, they seat firmly. I recommend them for days that you feel a little more fashionable than basic black. Great lenses. I am considering a pair of ice blue ones due to the ease of change and durability of these lenses.', 1747: \"The replacement lenses fit how they are supposed to and we're very easy to install. The color wasn't exactly what I thought they were going to be but, they get the job done.\", 1748: 'Replacing my scratched-up lenses was very easy.  Just pop the old lenses out, and install the new ones.  They work great!', 1749: \"This is the 2nd pair of replacement lenses I have put in my Oakley Juliet's.  The first replacement pair were NOT oakley and I got what I paid for...coating flecked off within a year.  These are absolutely beautiful in typical Oakley fashion.  If you are considering the replacement of your lenses you will be better off spending a couple extra bucks and getting replacement lenses directly from the source.\", 1750: 'This is the third set of lenses for my Juliets.  i tried a cheap off brand that claims to fit the Juliets, not hardly.  I might as well thrown a $20 bill right in the garbage.You get what you pay for.These fit perfectly as always.', 1751: 'Carbon frame with black iridiumHad a few scratches on my old lenses and wanted to go with something a bit more aggressive.The ruby lenses look very nice in the carbon setupJust a little clarification, these are NOT POLARIZED, figured as much as the are going for just 65, same price as oakley store, get it with prime for faster shipping', 1752: 'I got tired of my plasma lenses so i decided to replace it with ruby lenses. They fit perfectly and look nice too.', 1753: \"I was debating if I should purchase new sunglasses or not but still like the style of my Juliets.  They've been beat up over the years with multiple scratches on the lenses but the frames were still solid.  Bought these and received the next day.  Took all of 3 minutes to change out the lenses which fit perfectly.  You will need a T6 Torx driver to remove the screws.  Just buy this setTEKTON 2841 Everybit and Electronic Repair Screwdriver Bit Set, 135-Pieceas I did and you'll have all the specialty drivers you'll probably ever need.  Love the color compared to the previous grey lenses I had.\", 1754: 'Perfect fit, it was easy to change the lens myself.  I will probably purchase another set of lens in the near future.', 1755: \"Now my Juliet's are whole again. I'm sooooo freaking happy.Nice, in box.

Buying from amazon allowed me to receive these lenses in 2 days using prime and saved on tax and shipping.  Plus Oakley tends to drag there feet on shipping sometimes.  Upon arrival, lenses were in perfect condition.  Installed into frame and found one lens was loose in the frame.  I swapped it into another frame and it appeared ok.  This is not the first time an OEM Oakley lens has done this.  I bought them directly from Oakley and had this problem.  Other then that, this is not my first lens purchase from amazon, and it won't be my last.....\", 1759: 'Careless use on my part had resulted in terrible scratches on the lenses of my Oakley Whisker sunglasses. They were the first pair of \"nice\" sunglasses I had owned, and I was sad that they were so badly scratched. I ordered these for $85 (I believe) with free shipping. They fit perfectly into my glasses and were very easy to replace. I did have to work a bit on one side because the frame was a little bent, again from my rough use.Note: You\\'ll need glasses repair tools to put these in. Usually available in a kit for just a couple of dollars, including a very tiny screwdriver etc. Alternately, you can take these to a glasses or sunglasses store and they might be nice enough to swap them out for you.Bottom Line: Cheaper than replacing the glasses, and at the time I ordered cheaper than getting direct from Oakley since they charged shipping which was free through Amazon.Hope this helps!', 1760: 'These are the exact replacement lenses for my original Whisker glasses.  Easy to replace the old scratched lenses.  Glasses are like new again.', 1761: \"Ok.. I hesitated to order those lenses because the description says non polarized... if you  are looking for the polarized one these are the one yes they are polarized the manufacturer number matched the Oakley whisker black iridium polarized and so is the picture I found another pair of lenses on amazon that said polarized and if you read the reviews they aren't. hope this helps\", 1762: 'The Oakley Gascans were exactly what I was looking for at an excellent price from Amazon. Thanks!', 1763: \"...like mine. I shopped for a long time before ordering these. I've had Ray-Bans for years, but decided to buy Oakleys this time because they are US made.

Wear these all day, forgetting you are wearing them at times.You will not buy a cheap pair of sunglasses again after loving these bad boys.Ordering process was very simple, service was fantastic considering my location.I have seen these glasses sell at retail for $280, mine were $170.If these break, I will just get another pair, the same..... through Amazon.', 1773: \"Great glasses. Gave 4 stars because the case they came in didn't have the flak jacket padding to hold extra lenses if I bought some.\", 1774: 'These sunglasses were a gift for my husband.  He loves them.

Light weight and polarized is great for the active guy he is.', 1776: \"I am disappointed with the initial quality of the product. I returned the first pair because the frame was warped or crooked and didn't sit on my face correctly. The replacement pair seem to be better but not perfect.

Overall I'm satisfied with them but don't feel worth the price tag.\", 1777: 'these glasses are light weight but extremely effective. Blocks all the sun perfectly.  I will definitely purchase these again when and if I need to.', 1778: 'I replaced my broken Oakley M-Frames with this pair. So far, I am quite pleased with the fit and the lenses. I liked the M-Frames for their wide lens and good peripheral vision coverage. Oakley Flak Jacket glasses also provide full peripheral vision coverage, but are not quite as good as the M-Frames for wind protection. I do find that the Flak Jacket frame fits a bit better and otherwise feels more secure.This is also my first pair of polarized lenses. I stayed away as I hated the artifacts (depth illusions and shimmering) in other polarized lenses. Oakley lenses have the least such artifacts, and I really have to attentively look to notice them. For example, they put the Native polarized lenses to shame.', 1779: 'I was looking for replacements for my old Half Jackets.  I liked the Flak Jakets, but not the price at Sunglass Hut ($210).  I was skeptical that they were actually polarized and included a case, but I stand corrected. This is a great pair of glasses and an even better price!', 1780: \"I wanted a new pair of Oakleys that were not wires.  I like to golf and bike and the wire frames hurt the sides of my head after wearing them too long.  I have an odd shaped head so the bulky glasses look weird on me.  I originally wanted the XLJ lenses but after trying them on decide to go with these.  They look and feel great.  I was pleasantly surprised when they came with a zip up case.  The case holds the sunglasses as well as two extra pairs of lenses.  As usual, you can't beat the price offered by Amazon.\", 1781: \"I have never spent over $100 on a pair of sunglasses before until now.  I have always bought either Oakley's on clearance that weren't polarized, or really cheap sunglasses that were polarized but made of horrible quality.These glasses were my first dive into expensive eye wear, and I am not regretting the buy at all.  I haven't had a single migraine since wearing them, I am pretty sure that the radiating light bouncing up from the roadways and other vehicles were penetrating my old sunglasses and causing headaches.Also, go fishing with these things on.  You will see further into the water than ever before.  It's unreal!!!Great quality, great glasses, and they look good.  These are an excellent buy.\", 1782: \"If I sat on these, I would probably buy another pair. Not before a solid session of weeping though. These are somewhat expensive, but I take care of my sunglasses. My last pair of Nike Skylons lasted me about 7-8 years. These are better. They hug your head, and the rubber earpieces aren't denaturing like the Nike pair did. The lenses are replaceable, like the Nike ones, except they still make replacement lenses for these. The nose pads are also replaceable. This means that I would have to sit on these to buy another pair. Otherwise, all the parts can be replaced easily. Black/Black looks good, and the tint is nice. It took a little getting used to with the polarized lenses, since I'm not really accustomed to them, but these are good for every application of sunglasses. I recommend these to anyone that likes the style. Also, these fit a little bigger than the half jackets, which were too small for my head.\", 1783: 'Not all Oakleys fit me, but these do. I tried a pair of Oakley Juliet  at first, and they were not nearly as nice fitting. They were quite lose and were impossible to get on under a motorcycle helmet. These work well for that and are comfortable. They also seem relatively sturdy.', 1784: \"I purchased these glasses for use overseas. They conform to military eye-ware standards and look nice enough to wear off-base as well. These glasses lasted a full deployment with everyday use. At the end of the deployment I had to purchase new lenses for $90, they lasted this time for 2 more years. Just recently I've been considering purchasing another pair because the lenses are ready for replacement and the frame is looking a little rough.  What finally pushed me to get another pair is I've managed to lose the pair I own. But, because the glasses were such an amazing, reliable product - I am purchasing the exact same thing.\", 1785: 'I am once again amazed by the unbeatable deals in Amazon. I knew what I wanted. The same item was priced at $220 at Sunglass hut. Polarized is the way to go. Extremly easy on the eyes. I used to get headaches whenever I  used my Rayban in the sun and snow but after using Oakley my headaches are gone.', 1786: \"I love the style of the Flak Jacket. This is my second pair. Unfortunately, when I received them there was a defect in the right lens that prevented it from staying set. It was corrected by the local Oakley store without hassle, but I would have preferred not to have run that errand. I'll think twice before my next Oakley purchase.\", 1787: \"The premium price of the The Oakley Flak Jacket Polarized version may turn away some but they are a great set of active wear sunglasses. You do pay a lot more for the Polarized version. However, they are light, sturdy and the strategic rubber nose and over the ear components grip well. The polarized lenses are impressive and perform great in sunlight, against glare and on water.I'm awaiting a replacement since the ones that arrived had a manufacturing flaw on the left lens where the coating seems to have shifted a bit during production and there was something in the center of the lens. I can't wait to get the replacements, they are a great set of glasses.Having worn the Half Jacket XLJ Polarized model for running which are a bit smaller and has curved arms that wrap around the head a bit more I was worried about the Flak Jackets. They are just a tad wider and they bounced on the nose bridge at first however it's true they grip better as one starts to perspire.Also the hydrophobic coating on the Flak Jacket is a great feature. Sweat, rain, moisture and most things just fall right off without any streaks or marks. The Flak Jacket comes with the kit to keep the coating fresh. The kit can be used on any set of glasses and it also makes them hydrophobic.\", 1788: \"I finally broke down and bought a nice pair of sunglasses, after living with cheap sunglasses for too long I decided it was time for an upgrade.  I was looking for a sharp looking pair that would stick on my head through physical activities and let me tell you, the Oakley Flak Jackets are just that.  While a pair with polarized lenses can cost you a pretty penny, it is well worth the cost when you can actually see properly in bright sunlight.  I use these glasses at work, while biking, playing softball, outdoor hockey(The reduction of glare from the sun on the ice makes an incredible difference.)  These glasses have -never- slipped off of my head during any of these activities, never ever.  I've owned them for just over a year now and there is not a scratch on them.  So if you are in the market for a new pair of sunglasses and looking to take it to the next level, I would highly recommend a pair of Oakley Flak Jackets.\", 1789: 'I purchased the sunglasses for my wife and she loves them! The fact that they are polarized and fashionable add to her enamoration for them. What I love about them is the price. I was able to purchase them for 35-40% less than they would have cost me in store. This is my second pair of Oakleys purchased from Amazon and I guarantee my next pair will be as well!', 1790: 'I ride with these every day. third pair. worth every cent. My windsheild in my car will crack before these shades when i ride...love em', 1791: \"Once you have worn Oakley's you will never be satisfied with anything else.  The quality of the material, especially the lenses, is unsurpassed.  The clarity is noticeable immediately.\", 1792: \"These are the best sunglasses I have ever owned.  They're much less bulky than the Oakley X-Rays I used to have, easier to fit in pockets when I have to dress up.  Despite the smaller size they still protect the eyes, I see no appreciable glare below the lenses.  I sprung for the polarized lenses and I highly recommend that feature as well.  The glasses stay on without sacrificing comfort, they're comfortable and sweat free during sports, and they seem just as durable and sturdy as the other Oakley glasses I've had in the past.  I recommend them highly, first rate product.\", 1793: \"I've owned several Oakley sunglasses over the years and I always buy polarized lenses because my eyes are very sensitive to bright light.  These sunglasses fit very well and compliment the shape of my face (square).  The only negative aspect is that a blind-spot is created for me when driving because of the width of the temple.  I have to be more careful when changing lanes just to make sure there's no car or motorcycle there.  It takes a little getting used to when driving but otherwise these are great sunglasses.  You can't go wrong with Oakley!\", 1794: 'The look, fit, comfort and clarity of these sunglasses are amazing.  I love mine and wear them all the time.', 1795: \"I lost my previous pair after they fell out of my fanny pack while on a motorcycle ride and had to use a back-up pair for several weeks until I could order these new Oakley's. I am so happy to have these back! They fit me well and give me the best protection for my very sun-sensitive eyes; they are stylish; and the lenses are just the best. They are crystal clear with just the perfect level of shading and the lenses don't get as smudged as all others with their iridium coating. Very easy to clean as well. Oakley has a great product in these cool shades!\", 1796: 'the very best sunglasses i ever had, they are incredible and beautifull. Excellent product and the shipping very good and very fast. Thank you for send me to my country Ecuador.', 1797: \"Seem like very high quality so far.  Very stable fit.  Only complaint is the lens size doesn't cover up the old man bags under my eyes.\", 1798: \"I've been looking for a sunglass that is light and won't touch my cheeks.I am asian and really have a hard time finding one that will suits me.After checking some reviews, I finally decided to buy Flak Jacket asian fit here in amazon.When I received the item, I knew I got the right decision.It is very light as they said, wont give you headache. You won't notice that you are wearing it.I already have few oakley sunglasses - Juliet is too heavy it hurts my nose, dangerous and flaunt is also to heavy on long time wear, whisker is light but not sturdy when you sit on it. The frame fit will somehow bend, which the fit will no longer the same.And the best part of all - the lens won't touch your cheeks. It just hang there in front of your eyes - thanks to the nose pad. Really nice fit!The style is simple and not too sporty. You can typically use it as your everyday sunglass.So guys, choose Flak jacket!\", 1799: 'Fit perfect. A little hard to get on but thats understandable. The white ones are hard to keep clean but other than that there great!', 1800: \"The pieces in this kit worked perfectly for replacing the missing and worn out nose guard pieces on my husbands Oakley Flak Jackets. He had lost one of the nose guards, so we needed to order something to replace it, and I found this kit with it listed there were some included. When I received it, not only did I find it came with the nose guard pieces, it actually comes with two sets, each a different size. One size is a little larger than the other. So you actually get 4 nose guard pieces, even though only 2 are shown in the product photo.I replaced the pieces on his sunglasses a few days ago and so far they have stayed affixed and not come off. He's been wearing each day at work and say they feel just like they did with the original pieces. So I'd say if you have a pair of Flak Jackets that need a few replacement pieces, this kit is an awesome choice!\", 1801: 'Easy way to change your look of expensive glasses with out buying new ones. good color options available.

Gone are the sticky, deteriorating old rubber components.Installing the forward pieces on the arms was a bit tricky. To remove the arms, one must rotate to the folded position then twist them out while squeezing the hinge area of the arm. They're held by a ball and socket retaining system. This did a little damage to one of the pins and sockets, but it all went back together okay. Sliding the new pieces onto the arms is an exercise in patience, pushing and pulling. Be sure to wipe all the old gooey stuff off the plastic first. I don't use anything to 'lube' it for installation, since I'm not sure what might cause deterioration of the rubber.The kit came with TWO sets of replacement nose pieces. I think one set is slightly thicker than the other for a choice of positioning the glasses on your nose.\", 1808: \"It's nice to be able to replace the parts on my glasses rather than buying new ones.

NOTE: it's tremendously hard to slip the long piece up the arms w/o lubricant of some type.  The first one (dry) took like 15 minutes.  On the second one I applied a 1/4 drop of dish soap on the arm of the glasses, rubbed it around, and the earsock slipped right on in seconds!

I bought a pair of Oakley Plaintiffs and this case works perfectly... Glasses fit perfectly... Very durable and snaps shut which is nice...

It gives me piece of mind whenever I put my glasses in my backpack or when my friends hit my bag to play around. Its definitely durable and very hard. (Haha) the only 2 minor down sides to the case is that it looks a little funny and its not exactly built for housing big glasses even small spies have a tight fit because oakleys sunglasses fold almost flat unlike other sunglass products.

Unfortunately, even though I'm prety careful with my glasses after a year or two they inevitably get all scratched up.These replacement lenses pop in without any fuss and I'm back to pure crystal clear optical joy in a jiffy.

I lost them last year and looked to replace them with the same. Unfortunately Oakley redesigned the Minute with massive chunky arms and giant logos all over. I found the Fives through Oakley Standard Issue site for military personnel and looked them up on Amazon for purchase. The Fives fit just like the old Minutes, snug to the head, low profile, sturdy and easy to snap back together if they get crushed in your pocket. I highly recommend these if you are looking for a reliable, not too flashy pair of Oakley's.\", 1906: \"I've owned two pair because i sat on the first one. They fit like a glove and are great for running and cycling. Perfect for those of us with smaller noggins.\", 1907: 'These were \"issued\" to us by our squad leaders in Iraq.  They got set up with U.S. Standard Issue which is a military/government direct sales program from Oakley.  So instead of being stuck with the actual \"standard issue\" eye protection, we rolled around Iraq sportin\\' Oakleys.I have to say these are the best sunglasses I\\'ve ever owned.  I\\'m a chronic destroyer of sunglasses, and I just can\\'t do it to these.  The \"\\'O\\' Matter\" material is some sort of composite plastic similar to that used in pistol frames (think of these as the Glock of sunglasses).  Through dust storms, being crammed into various pockets and daypacks, and a handful of big boom experiences, these glasses came through with only a few scratches.The frames are designed with a sort of crush-proofing:  If you sit on them or step on them, the lenses and temples will just pop out, rather than breaking.  Now, you really have to abuse them, they won\\'t just pop apart under normal or even heavy use.  But if you should happen to really crunch them, you just pop them back together and go on your merry way.This particular frame works best for those with narrow or small faces.  A lot of other frames extend past the side of your face and let in dust, wind and sun.  But these fit almost like goggles.  I\\'ve worn them on the motorcycle and they do well right up to highway speeds without a face shield.The only improvement, and this is pretty much a universal complaint about Oakley\\'s, is that the lenses are \"soft\", meaning they scratch pretty easily.  But as eye-protection, the whole point of them is to absorb the impact without shattering or breaking.  So they do what they\\'re supposed to do.  Just keep them clean when you can.Sadly, Oakley is discontinuing production of this workhorse.  As of yet, they do not have an alternative for small/narrow faces, other than the Juliet (metal framed version, for around $350).  So get these while you still can.', 1908: 'I purchased the Oakley Fives 2.0 after my M-Frames broke.  Bought them online without previously testing for proper fit and they fortunately turned out to fit very well.  For a bang-for-buck comparison, my M-Frames cost twice as much and only lasted me half as long.  I would still be using them had I not forgotten them at church, where whoever happened upon them found the temptation too great and never returned them to \"Lost and Found\".  It\\'s a shame Oakley discontinued this product.Here\\'s a quick list of pros and cons:Pros:- Extremely well made.  They are almost indestructible.  The arms have no screws or metal hinges.  They pop in an out.  These sunglasses have been thrown, sat on, and stepped on by kids and adults and the worst that\\'s happened was the arms popping off, which take only a few seconds to reassemble.- Design is nice and fits with business and sports use.- They are one of the few Oakley models that fit me without a big gap under the frame.- They are priced surprisingly lower than many weaker Oakley models.Cons:- They do not fit as securely as M-Frames.  They\\'ll be fine for a volleyball game at the beach, but for the more demanding sports, you\\'d likely be better served by M-Frames.- Not technically a Fives 2.0 shortfall, but Oakley does not offer many lens options.  Darker lenses would be nice.Overall, very nice product.', 1909: 'Nice stuff', 1910: 'These replacement lenses were perfect.

I'm very satisfied with this purchase and will definitely purchase again when the need arises.\", 1913: 'Great communications and arrived as described', 1914: \"I bought these for my Half Jacket for the shooting range.

Oakley's are definitely worth the investment.\", 1915: \"I have two frames for my Oakley Half Jackets, and I have multiple lenses.  Recently I had a set of prescription lenses made for these frames.  The fit was ok at best and I think that the prescription switched left and right eyes.  I needed a set of safety lenses and these fit the bill.  I went with the Oakley lenses because I wanted the manufacturer to back them.  The clarity is perfect, I can hardly tell that I'm wearing the lenses.  They resisted fogging fairly well.  As with all of their lenses, they are approved for use as safety glasses.  I'm more than pleased with these lenses.  I also bought another set for my girlfriend so that we can use them when we go shooting!\", 1916: 'I swap these lenses into my Oakley Half Jacket frames for indoor shooting range use.Clear, quick to change and the frame I use is more comfortable than the cheap $20 shooting range glasses', 1917: \"I purchased these clear replacement lens because I was having difficulty seeing in the woods while mountain biking.  I don't know why I waited so long.  This really helped my riding and the lens are very easy to replace.

When the package came, I was pretty excited, then I opened it, these glasses weren't exactly what I expected.  However, I did learn to love them, at first I thought they may have been too big for my face, but I think they fit just right, they are comfortable and of good quality as to be expected.  My second concern is less important, I felt like the big &#34;O&#34; on the side was a bit too big, however I have gotten used to them and they are all around a good pair of sunglasses, just be aware, they may not be for everyone!\", 1920: 'These are one of the basic models of Oakleys, but their simple design is a good, comfortable fit for larger heads.', 1921: \"I'm a huge fan of Oakley sunglasses, particularly the Antix style.

I will say this, if you don\\'t mind waiting awhile for your order to be processed, then check out other products offered by ItaliaImage, as their prices are very competitive.

Except I tried on the pair that had non-polarized lenses. I ordered the polarized lenses because I spend a lot of time on the water (ocean) but when I received the glasses I noticed the lenses are not very dark at all. Oakley rates these lenses at a 3/4 (4/4 is considered very dark and not recommended to wear while driving.) except I don't think the lenses are dark enough (thats why I only have 4 stars instead of 5) Another problem I have is the glasses do NOT come with a hard case, only a soft bag. After spending $120 on glasses I think a hard case should be included. Over all I am very happy with the glasses, just don't expect dark lenses or a hard case, but you can expect a quality product from Oakley.\", 1998: 'Simple and light, very nice sunglasses.

Thank God it fits nice onto my face. Love this Oakley very much. Recommended.', 2002: \"Originally bought these sunglasses for cycling, and now wear them all the time. The interchangeable lenses makes it easy to swap in the polarized lenses (which I bought separately) for the vented lenses (for riding), and the quality is outstanding. Clear vision, no fogging, and wraps far enough to the sides to maintain excellent peripheral vision. I can't recommend these glasses highly enough (but they no longer make this specific model; the Jawbone has been replaced with the Racing Jacket. They share the same lenses, however, and a nearly identical geometry, so I suspect they will be just as good).\", 2003: 'Just got these last month and thought I\\'d share my thoughts.Quite simply, these are the BEST riding glasses I\\'ve ever owned. I don\\'t say this lightly. I\\'ve been riding 10+ years and have had just about every brand, including Vuarnet, other Oakleys, Ray Ban, etc. You name it, I\\'ve tried it in search of the \"perfect\" riding specs.Fit: I have an average face, and these are a dream. They don\\'t squeeze my temples at all, and the arms are flexible enough to ensure a tight fit without hurting. The biggest benefit is the lower and upper frame fits against my cheek and brow, keeping wind and road debris out. It is also large enough to keep sunlight out of the top and sides, and peripheral vision is not compromised at all.Optics: Nothing beats polarized lenses. A quick review: Light comes in waves (see: quantum mechanics) and this causes natural distortion as the light bends across the eye\\'s own lens and hits the retina. Polarized lenses dramatically decrease this distortion (too detailed to explain here). That means you see that pebble from 100 feet instead of 15, that small hole from 200 feet instead of 40. It is AMAZING how clearly you see things. I ride one route very regularly, so I know every nook and cranny of it. At least I thought I did. The first ride on that same course with the Jawbones exposed some hidden dangers I had never seen with my Oakley Scalpels, Laser, or Flak Jackets (or any other glasses for that matter). It is amazing what TRUE polarization provides. Now, you often see the word \"polarized\" advertised on glasses costing less than $100, and that is a bunch of b.s. You can\\'t do it right for such a low cost. Why do you think Ray Bans all cost $125 and up? Because they do polarization right. And so does Oakley.Cyclocomputer: One of the ways you can tell glasses have lesser optics is when you look at your cyclocomputer, there are dark and bright areas (I have a Garmin Edge 305). With Jawbones, every # and letter is crystal clear and easy to read. I don\\'t have to lift my glasses anymore to read the display. That\\'s important for safety.Light Filtering: In even the brightest sunlight, these work like a charm. No pair has provided the light obscuring effects these do. The amazing part? I was out on a ride, and what was a sunny day turned dark and rain soaked. Somehow, and I don\\'t know how, these glasses did not make it seem darker. They almost know how to let more light in when it\\'s cloudy. I was able to see just as clearly going out as coming back. And the water just beaded up on the glasses, unlike other glasses where it blotches everywhere. This is due to the hydrophobic coating. Further, because they are close to your face, rain didn\\'t seep in through the top part of the frame.Iridium: I don\\'t know what the purpose is of this compound, but whatever it does, it works. Perhaps it is to reduce glare? If so, it works.Vents: They have designed ingenious vents in both lenses, in the outer upper portions. But they\\'re not normal vents. Normal vents let air enter in a laminar pattern, which directs it straight into the eye and dries it out. By using small dividers in their vents, they produce turbulent flow, which creates a vortex of air in FRONT of the eye very close to the rear of the lens, so your eye never feels the breeze. This is exactly where it is needed to keep the lens from fogging up from perspiration or when it rains.UV protection: Guaranteed 100% against UVA (low energy, but penetrates pretty deep), UVB (does most eye damage), and UVC (a new player, generally considered the most powerful of the UV spectrum). I have no machine for testing this claim, but I\\'m sure Oakley does, and if they say it, I\\'m inclined to believe it.Frame: It is hinged, and unfortunately, it is a tad difficult to open it to swap out the darker for the yellow lenses. However, I have another pair of lighter colored glasses (Bolle) with yellow lenses, so I wear these when needed. Thus, I don\\'t plan on ever switching the lenses on the Jawbone. While I\\'m sure they work well, I have never used them so I can\\'t comment here.Protection: I got hit square in the middle of the lens with a rock during a paceline, and it just bounced off. No scratch, dings, or damage. And this was a BIG pebble. Other glasses might have broken or scratched, but not these. I was amazed quite frankly. These glasses meet the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specs for impact protection. ANSI specifies protection levels for motorcycle helmet shields, for example. `Nuff said.Summary: If you want the ultimate in fit, geometry, sun filtering, road debris protection, polarization for maximum clarity, and on and on, then these are the glasses for you. If you can\\'t get yourself to spend the money to provide your eyes with all the advanced benefits of the Jawbone, then I suggest you buy the $15 pair from CVS and call it a day. However, they\\'ll fall short of these spectacular biking sunglassesFor me, it\\'s the Jawbone. Nothing else even remotely compares.FIVE MONTH FOLLOW UP:I\\'ve put a good many miles on the bike with these glasses. They continue to amaze. They seem to resist smudging and water drops, which don\\'t splatter, they just stay as drops so you can see through them in the rain. One minor issue is that they are polarized which it makes it somewhat difficult to see my computer when riding. I have to make sure my head is tilted at the proper angle to be able to read it, otherwise the light entering the glasses is at an improper angle and gets filtered out, thus unreadable. But that means they\\'re also filtering out ALL the bad wavelengths, which is what makes them so crisp and sharp. I gave my Oakley Lasers to my son, which he loves, so we\\'re both happy.Enjoy the ride!!', 2004: \"Received them on promised date.  Would've given 5 stars but not happy about the seal if broken on box you can't return them. So if I received a broken pair im stuck with them.  But very pleased with my new shades.\", 2005: 'These glasses are really nice and attractive. They fit well on a small face too. I would definitely recommend them.', 2006: 'I purchased these from a friend for $120 so that being said idk ab 220 but for 120 i am very happy. Came with tons of accesories and cool case and different lense option. I have a decently wide face to me anyway and they still fit fine. Just thought id give my review for wood be buyers bc of all the reviews ive seen on Oakleys on here is the lack of reference to their own face. Hope this helps. Also bought the livestrong flak jackets on here waiting on them to come in!!', 2007: 'This sunglasses are amaIng, suitable for day and night, highly recomended to improve your night vision while jogging in the dark  and helps to reduce the interference of other light sources like the car lights,', 2008: 'Great product, look great, and fit well. The lenses change very easily. The extra lens is a nice touch. The nose pads also change easily once you figure out how to do it (open jaw, remove lenses, and it is somewhat counter intuitive, but push the nose pad forward, not backward). Unlike most frames, you really do forget that you have them on. They also handle bike rides well with the vented lenses--no fogging. One other noticeable advantage is how well they stay in place once you put them on. Love them.', 2009: \"Hi. I'm from Ecuador.I bought this sunglasses and it work wonderfully.I have manny Oakley's sunglasses and make a good job\", 2010: 'This sunglasses is worth its price. It is light and provides clear view in spite of the glaring sun light. This is my 3rd Oakley glasses.', 2011: 'A number of the guys and gals in my cycling group sport the Jawbone glasses and loved them. I was torn between these and the Radar glasses so I went down to the nearest Oakley store and tried each of them on. I decided on the Jawbone, and here\\'s why:The Jawbone glasses have a lower lip that extends a below the frame and provides a little more eye protection. I\\'ve taken a small rock to the face on more than one ride and know how easily a rock can fly up under a lens. The Radars don\\'t have any lower lip and leaves some room for a rock to potentially sneak through and hit your eye.While I\\'m sure this is not a big deal to some people and the Radars are a great choice, the lower lip makes me feel warm and fuzzy.It was a tough decision too because I like the fact that the Radars give you a little more visibility by not having the lower lip.Also, Oakley uses a patented lens material they call \"Plutonite\" which is extremely durable. No rocks are going to be breaking through my lenses! After looking at the Oakley website, I learned that their Plutonite also provides exceptional visibility, which is important when going downhill at speeds over 50mph!One other thing that I like about both pairs of Oakleys, but really like about the Jawbone, is the ease of changing lenses. I sweat a lot, thanks to my family DNA, and it\\'s nice to quickly change my lenses at the group rendevous point without hassle. The Jawbones make changing my lenses easy enough to swap in less than 2 minutes.Either way, I only use Oakley and wanted a good pair of glasses that I could count on for eye protection, great visibility, and general good looks!', 2012: 'Great sunglasses, a high recommendation to any cyclists out there. No wind in my eyes, sweat rolled right off the lenses without leaving any mark. I only got the loud colors I did because it matches my bike and I am a University of Iowa fanatic (which is why my bike was that color to begin with). Anyway, what a great pair of cycling glasses.', 2013: 'Great sunnies, very suitable for cycling. Love wearing them. the overall package with replacement lenses, holder and cleaning materials tops off the the deal.', 2014: 'excelente, sin Recomendado Producto 100%. pacticos muy, comodos, Livianos, s&iacute; ajustan al Rostro perfecto y la visi&oacute;n Con Ambos cistrales ni Hablar. tipico de la Marca Oakley.', 2015: 'I bought these sunglasses because the other sunglasses I used for sport were already getting scratched and falling off my face a lot. I play a lot of outdoor basketbal and other sports and I have serious eye issues (I\\'ve had retinal detachments in the past) . Pretty much, I needed something to protect my eye from direct impact to avoid going blind. I bought these only because they were on special (yay!) and the fact that they had Oakley\\'s 3 point system (they only touch your nose and sides of face). Here\\'s a short list of things you can expect with these sunglasses.Looks:The sunglasses are gorgeous, I always admired the Oakley Jawbones. I\\'m hispanic so I tend to have a slightly dark, tanned skin color and have a long and skinny face but with a strong jawline. The yellow on the bottom adds a really nice touch. Now, it does take time to get used to how they look because the yellow is really bright but it does look really good. Since I\\'m slightly dark, my skin balances the really bright yellow. They might not look too good on those who are slightly pale especially with the yellow on the backs of the legs of the glasses.Build:The Jawbones are made of a nice and sturdy plastic. I\\'ve always trusted Oakley with the build quality and this pair does not differ from my standards for them. They are just as strong. The lenses are replaceable and the glasses have maneuvering to add/remove new lenses. Just lift the nosepiece, lower the \"jaw\" and replace. Easy.Protection:This is going to sound pretty funny but when I got these I told my girlfriend to push them into my face (to test how well I can be protected from impact). If I were to be hit square in the face, the sunglasses would concentrate the blow onto the top of my nose (due to that 3 point system mentioned earlier). The glasses do not touch my eyes at all so I have no worry about another detached retina. Maybe I\\'d have to worry about a broken nose, but I\\'d rather have a broken nose than a broken eye :pAs far as protection from the sun, I can\\'t add much to Oakley\\'s already great reputation. Oakley\\'s reputation for this is just too much. The Black Iridium lenses are nice and dark and have 10% light transmission. In other words, they\\'re dark enough for anything.Performance:They feel as if nothing is there. They are lightweight and the lenses have holes on the outer edges that \"vent\" so the lenses do not cloud over from sweat and humidity. They have their HD Optics which supposedly protect from sweat and smudges but I don\\'t know how that\\'s possible. My pair already has some fingerprint smudges. Regardless, nothing a microfiber cloth can\\'t do.Accessories:The box includes a black and yellow case, extra nosepieces, extra yellow lenses and pouches for lenses and the glasses. The case is nice. It has respectively shaped \"pockets\" to snugly fit 2 pairs of extra lenses and the sunglasses themselves. I haven\\'t tried the extra nosepieces but it is to my understanding that they are different sizes to accommodate different shaped noses and faces but don\\'t hold me to that. I heard that somewhere but my memory might just be failing me. The extra yellow lenses are for indoor sports and allow 90% light transmission so they let most light in. They will give your eyesight a slightly yellowish/brownish tint. They can probably be used for other outdoor,  ill-lit situations such as during a sunset. The black lenses will definitely be too dark for that situation.All in all I am very happy with my purchase. These are exactly what I needed in every aspect of what I was looking for in a pair of sunglasses. From all this, the only downside I can point out is the iridium on the lenses. Don\\'t get me wrong, they make things look great but are extremely delicate. They can probably get scratched from a direct blow. My parents had iridium Oakleys in the past and scratches randomly appeared on the lenses (probably from them putting the glasses in purses and pockets). And if you ever need to clean them, you will need a microfiber cloth and the spray that Oakley sells which I believe runs for about 10 bucks. All I can say is, if you need sporty sunglasses, get these, they are all you would ever need.', 2016: 'The grip its great, they are very light wich makes them very comfortable, while biking they work perfect the only fact its that if you are going to use them to run they get foggy if you aint running at a considerable speed to let the air came thru te holes... Besides that they are a great choice', 2017: 'Excellent product of the highest quality, specifically bought so I could add prescription lenses to complement the lenses that came with the product.

Otherwise, this is a great deal.  Comes with a different size set of nose pieces for people with flatter bridges or just want more space between the lens and their eye(lashes).  The rubber on the sides help these stay on through moderate activity.  These lenses are not polarized, but still has incredible optics.', 2021: \"I own this AV style and the Square style in a polarized lens.  The lenses are excellent in both -- best I've ever had.  The sunglasses are sporty and made for high level activity -- hiking, running -- they're lightweight and will not fall off.  I prefer the Square style -- it better suits a smaller face.  When I ordered from Amazon, they did not specify which style of Commit they carried.  I thought about returning the sunglasses, but decided I liked them enough to keep.  Lens replacements for Commit can also be gotten in the square shape for this frame.  All in all, a pleased purchaser!\", 2022: \"I like the look of the Oakely glasses, but my main reason for choosing them is the polarized lenses.

This particular pair are exactly what I wanted. It's nice to have the option to change the lenses.  I'm glad to have found them for considerably less than the 130+$ that they want at the store where I tried the glasses on.

Received the sunglasses much sooner than anticipated.  These were a replacement of some that were stolen and they are the same quality.  Except the ones I replace had polorized lenses.

The price was great, specially since I had some gift cards amazon had given me.\", 2042: \"Frame: Polished Black w/ GunmetalLens: VR28 Black Iridium PolarizedI'll try to be objective, but there probably will be some subjective thoughts as well. I have worn these exclusively for about 3 weeks now. One thing is certain. Pit Boss will mark a heavy milestone in Oakley's history timeline.Thoughts on the styling: Within the Pit Boss, I see design elements most obviously from Valve (lower orbital spoilers) and Splice (dual color orbitals), concept ideas from Scar (dual materials), but also the orbital screw element from Juliet and the nosebridge-X from the Romeo. Not only do we have those elements, we also have the complex ear stem (curved scoring) from the newer Zero and Radar. The O square elements are in there too, as we have orbitals which are neither completely round or completely squared off, and fat ear stems which shoot straight back like that of a Gascan. The Monster Dog and, more so, the Monster Pup are also present. All these elements and more that I haven't noticed yet are tastefully integrated and flow together perfectly. These are indeed among Oakley's most aggressive frames ever conceived. I was on the fence between matte black w/ Ti w/ Black Iridium vs. Polished black w/ gun metal w/ VR28 BI. As others have already said, the VR28 base is a highly versitlie lens, and I thought that the Ti color plate was more flashy than the gun metal, so I ultimately went with the latter. Matte black w/ gun metal w/ VR28 BI would have been my colorway of choice however.Thoughts on the frame and fitment: The first thing you'll realize when you pull the glass from the upgraded, Elite microbag is that these are pretty beefy frames. Holding them, they will feel like they are expensive. Opening the ear stems, you'll notice that the cam detent is not present, and that the ear stems are held in place by pressure. The ear stems are hinged with a watch pin (underneath the riveted titanium plate) which is a bonus. As others have mentioned already, nosebombs and earsocks are not present, but truthfully the weight and pressure of the frame alone will secure the frame in one place and prevent it from sliding on the nose. The ear stems wrap around the head tightly, but comfortably along the lines of original Straight Jacket, and there is no overhang near the temples. The titanium plates are thicker than I was expecting, and provide a significant part of the frame's styling. The plates are not gaudy or gimmicky in any way, but provide the most attention getting styling feature. Viewing through the lenses, you'll immediately notice that there are minimal frame obstructions. Overall, the fitment of the complete frame is very secure although you probably won't want to be going for a bike ride with them. You could play sports in them, but you probably wouldn't want to. These would be bad ass to wear at the beach.Thoughts on the the quality of finish: The polished black is actually a true jet black. Its by far the best painted o-matter finish I've ever seen. Other polished black frames, even when factory fresh, would have minor scuff and swirl marks, even straight machine lines coming off the icon of the ear stem. Not with Pit Boss. This indicates to me that the base o-matter frame is run off the production line at a much slower rate, with much more attention to detail and defects. The Ti plates are perfectly overlayed onto the o-matter frame, and neatly interfaces when frame is opened. There are no natural scuffs or flaws, and if they fingerprint (which they will) you just wipe them off with the suedeish microbag. I have a feeling that each and every frame receives a thorough visual inspection prior to being bagged and boxed. The new Elite icon is definitely cool, but it would have been more meaningful for it to have been stamped into the Ti plate. Its still just a metal scuplture with some 3M adhesive backing, which can be shifted around with your thumb just like all the other frames. Still, I really like the way the onyx black icon looks on the gun metal plate.Thoughts on the price: The price is certainly a cause for alarm. How much would have these frames cost had their been no Ti plates or extraneous packaging? I did some basic cost estimating, and figure the breakdown is as follows: the VR28 BI polarized hydrophobic w/ AR coating on the inner is $105 (AR is about $30 for both sides, it would $15 for one side), Ti plates is $265 (the current retail cost of a Juliet frame alone since I think there is just about as much material), $120 for the o-matter frame (most frames alone are $50-$60, but these are very well designed), $10 for hardware (8 rivets, 2 screws, 2 hinge pins), $55 for hand assembly and inspection, $50 for deluxe box w/ metal elite icon (yes, it is metal). Sum it up, and its $595 when there are retail considerations injected into every aspect of the complete sunglass to pay for the materials and R&D.; Still, some of my estimates were somewhat inflated to accomidate the retail price. I personally think these are worth a solid $400.In conclusion, these are a strong offering for the first in the Elite line. They are essentially everything I want in a frame, while maintaining clean lines with a highly aggressive and modern look. Although they won't make you an Elite, Pit Boss will help make you look Elite and turn some heads. Just be ready for it.\", 2043: 'I won\\'t over-aggrandise this item because of its high cost and ELITE prestige. The styling is keen, unique and every bit as it appears. I was a bit disappointed in the over-all feel of the glasses in that I feel as though I must \"baby\" them for fear or damaging them with scuffs and scratches or cause damage to the o-matter plastic. Not as confident in these as say the Romeo 1.0. Wearing them is comfortable and as I compare them to my Jawbones, they appear to be a bit more clear due to the lack of reflection from the inside. It is not the case that they are so much more superior lenses as it is maybe the limitation to light being inside with the eyes. I decided to go with the Gun-metal/polished/vr28 as I wanted a bit more subtle appearance. It still gets attention and as well i think it compliments my overall wardrobe better. Plus I have other glasses that have matt black/silver combination. I was glad to consider the cost measured against exclusiveness, renown, and that the Founder may no longer be a part of the creative aspects of the company. Also because it is rumored that Oakley will be doing away with metal frames.(hope not)', 2044: 'like always oakley the best, very good quality and received on time no comments, good product and fit perfect jeje.', 2045: 'I bought this ones as a present for my wife and she really love them.

I've been wearing this since July and still loving it.I also like the Amazon no-hassle return policy.  I purchased a pair of Oakley's in the past and had to return it.

Although I can\\'t say we have \"one face fits all\" description, we usually have problems finding sunglasses because of the following: Low, short nose bridge, high cheeks, and round face (wide at the temple).  Now with sunglasses, the choices are more limited than prescription frames.  Metal frames are usually recommended, because they are flat, and they come with nose pads and small lenses, which can be easily adjusted to fit anyone.  They wear just like prescription glasses.  But metal frames are fragile, gets hot in the heat, and the small frame doesn\\'t provide a lot of coverage from the sun.So after I misplaced my treasured unisex Fossil metal frame polarized sunglasses (this was highly recommended to me by a salesman after I explained my dilemma, and he thought it was the only compromise: good fit, but not a great pair for sun blocking), I started my search for the perfect pair: polycarbonate frame, large lens for a feminine style, slight warp around my face for coverage from the sun, doesn\\'t pinch my temples, and polarized.  I decided to try Oakley\\'s claimed \"Asian Fit\".I love the black frame and the hint of red.  I commend the fact that they actually sit on my short nose bridge.  However, they still do sit on my cheek a bit, albeit not as much as others I\\'ve tried, but definitely more than the small flat frames (they don\\'t touch my face).  They\\'re also a bit snug around my temple, which surprised me as this should be one of the main differences in \"Asian Fit\" glasses.  I knew that this model was already out of stock on Oakley\\'s website, so I checked to see if this is indeed what I ordered.  The frame has a small \"-A\" after the model name, and the lens has the \"polarized\" script on it.  So I assume this is the right thing, and for $60 less than the MSRP (I guess it was Amazon clearance).  Now, without ever trying on the regular Dangerous, I can\\'t say for sure if Oakley\\'s Asian Fit really makes that much of a difference.  All I can say is, even with one size fits most, these are not quite as Asian friendly as I hoped.  But since they\\'re so adorable, I\\'m keeping them anyway, and my eyes are still open for that perfect pair of sunglasses someday...', 2064: 'I have been in love with these glasses for a long time but was hesitant to buy them as was a lot of money to spend for polarized glasses.

The Gold Iridium lens work great in dawn and dusk when there is low light.Having worn the Half Jacket XLJ Polarized model for running which are a bit smaller and has curved arms that wrap around the head a bit more so they stick I was worried about the Flak Jackets not working as well. However it's true they grip better as one starts to perspire, they were a little bouncy on the bridge of the nose for a bit but they settled after I started perspiring.Also the hydrophobic coating on the Flak Jacket is a great feature. Sweat, rain, moisture and most things just fall right off without any streaks or marks. The Flak Jacket comes with the kit to keep the coating fresh.

They are pricey, but the lens is polycarbonate and impact resistant so it's worth it for the protection and if it means he'll wear them.  As for fit, he was 12 and is a tall but thin kid and these fit nicely in terms of width.

Mainly jackets, half jackets, fives, minutes, etc because of my narrower face shape. I was initially attracted to Oakleys because of their sporty style and was amazed at the level of clarity their lenses provided. So, onto the review of the Half Jacket\\'s...I purchased my half jackets at least 5 years ago at a Sunglass Hut. The pair I recieved was a package deal of the frames, with three different lenses (G30, black iridium, fire iridium I believe) and a softcase. The glasses are extremely lightweight and comfortable. Styling is a totally subjective thing and will be debated of course with any pair so I wont go into that further than to say that different sunglasses look better/worse on different face shapes. Selecting the style that is appropriately sized and shaped to fit you and look correct can be limiting but there are quite a few to choose from, for sure.The half jackets I used for YEARS for a plethora of outdoor activities and sports including volleyball, basketball and flag football among others. The glasses stay secured on your face and DO NOT fall off thanks to the light weight and rubber side sleeves and nose pieces. This brings me to my first \"flaw\" with these...The nose pieces have a tendency to come off every once in a while which means you WILL end up losing one, or both eventually. I would like to see a more secure connection for these pieces to ensure they stay put. My pair made it about 2 years or so before I lost the first side of the nose piece, and then a few months later the other was mysteriously missing as well. You can wear them without those peices, and they certainly still stay on just fine, its just not as comfortable with the plastic against your nose as opposed to the soft rubber. Next up is the lenses. The clarity as usual is stunning on all 3 lenses, however (and this may just be personal preference) I felt like the G30 (rose color) lenses were vastly superior to the other two in almost every situation. The rose lenses provided better contrast, excellent view in lower light areas while still blocking out enough sun and glare in full sun conditions and were even and consistent throughout all viewing angles from behind the lens. The fire iridium lenses have a multi-color coating that makes different sections of the lense (top/bottom/sides) appear differently lighted when viewing through them. While they look cool from the exterior, I wouldn\\'t recommend them for anything more than a fashion statement. The black iridium lenses were good for very high light conditions but didnt stand up to the G30 head to head in any other conditions. As for lense and frame durability, Oakley does a great job with their plastic frames by keeping the hinges all plastic. This means if you sit on them, they pop apart instead of breaking. They snap right back together and you\\'re good to go. The lenses are fairly durable and scratch resistant, but its inevitable with a plastic lens that you are going to get scratches. Micro scratches that you can see by looking very closely on the exterior of the lens will MOST times not even be viewable as you look through them while you\\'re wearing them. However, larger scratches will make you yearn for a replacement lens. I didnt have any real issues with the coatings wearing off or flaking. I\\'d recommend being careful what you clean the lenses with and where they go (IE- pools, ocean saltwater, etc) as this may affect the coatings bond over time. The Sunglass Hut is a national chain and I recently found out that they have a warranty period of I believe 60 days where if they are scratched, they can be replaced free of charge.Anyway, overall these are a terrific pair of sunglasses for the active sports enthusiast or beach-goer albeit a tad pricy for what you get as is typical these days with \\'high performance\\' sunglass manufacturers.', 2085: \"buenas tardes , gracias por enviar el producto esta en buen estado y execelente articulo Oakley Men's Half Jacket Iridium Sunglasses,Jet Black Frame/Black Lens...Oakley\", 2086: \"Man these sunglasses are tough.

I am glad I purchased them for my husband!Sincerly,Diana L. Walden', 2088: \"I have tried many different brands and types of sunglasses and none of them compare to these. The absolute clarity of the lens alone makes them worthwhile. But then add in that they are lightweight, stylish, have 100% UVA/UVB/UVC protection, and the fact that they don't slide off your face and the price becomes well worth it - especially when compared to other sunglasses similarly priced.\", 2089: \"These Oakley sunglasses the most versatile sunglasses for an active lifestyle.

As for me, I'm impressed by this pair - it personifies my active lifestyle, keeping everything within sight and life short and simple, and ultimately, sexy. I keep myself busy, and run often - so far, the glasses themselves do a wonderful job of providing eye protection against the harsh California/Florida sun. Without the glasses stopping the glare, tackling a half-marathon blind would be a daunting task.Question is: How do they stand up? Aesthetically, I've commented that they are quite pleasing to the eye. However, construction-wise, I think the engineers at Oakley hit the spot. The main purpose of the glasses for me will be for outdoor situations, and the build seems rugged enough to handle the rigors, and wear and tear of strenuous play.  As a previous owner of some Oakley Whiskers, there is a difference: as much as I loved those glasses too, I felt they weren't suited for the type of recreational running activities I am accustomed in doing. And unfortunately, the Whiskers were stolen.Now, the situation is more like a blessing in disguise, and I sport these Half-Jackets. Not only are they more affordable, but they are great in balancing my on-the-go persona while keeping my eyes in wonderful shape.The Half-Jacket is a definite must buy!\", 2092: 'Excellent glasses.  Comfortable, light-weight and they help me look good. Bought through Amazon at below retail price.', 2093: \"This is my second pair of Oakley Sunglasses. They are expensive but worth the money. Shop around for price. Extremely light weight, excellent fit, polarized lenses that really work and produce a vivid clarity filtering the harsh ultra violent sunrays. You will notice a HUGE difference. I also have an expensive pair of Ray Bans. They make everything look ultra dark and lack the clarity of the Oakleys. Buy a pair and you won't be disappointed. I also recommend that you purchase the Oakley Sunglass Case. Cost is about $25.00 and it's over kill for a pair of sunglasses. Very well made, durable and it offers excellent protection for your purchase.\", 2094: 'EDIT: August 11th, 2012I bought these for my husband in feb 2012. In 6 months he has not managed to scratch or break them. They have been through getting dropped, a toddler chewing and throwing them around, etc.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.

La calidad y el precio son lo maximo', 2102: \"For starters I didn't pay for mine, I got them for free when I bought a used car, the past owner left them in there and didn't bother to take them out, secondly, I know they are real as I was very suspicious at first and had them checked out by a guy at the Oakley store in the mall near where I Live.On the the review itself. I love these types of sunglasses due to their sporty look for bike riding and the easy ability to quickly change their lenses as long as you know how to do it. further I like how light they are yet don't feel flimsy and how they stick to your head and don't move around. and for price wise these are some of the cheapest Oakley's you can get, yet don't feel like a entry-line model.I used to think only idiot would spend 100+ dollars on sunglasses till I got these for free, since then I have purchased another pair of Oakley's and a paid of Ray-bans for dressier occasions, and not to mentioned turned my entire family on to the idea of designer sunglasses, don't listen to people who say you can get a pair just as nice at Walmart for 20 dollars, as soon as you own are pair of quality glasses you will never be able to go back to the cheap, Chinese made drug store sunglasses ever again.\", 2103: 'Love the glasses.  Light and they fit to perfection.  Great buying experience all around.', 2104: \"These are one of the best values in the sunglass world.

Great product.\", 2105: 'Very good. Had absolutely no problems with the order and it was delivered very promptly. Love my Oakleys!', 2106: 'Great product.

It's too bad that they are now discontinued.  And to a great degree that is the way of the new Oakley.\", 2109: \"I was very skeptical due to the price, thinking maybe were knockoffs, but they arrived in shorter time than had originally stated and in perfect brand new condition, with an Oakley sun glass pouch.  They are very well made, and were only 68.00 including shipping, couldn't ask for a better deal.\", 2110: 'I had been searching the internet for about a week looking for sunglasses similar to these ones.  I love Oakley sunglasses but I didn\\'t want to break the bank, so to speak.  I searched on various \"discount\" retailers and none of them had the sunglasses I wanted.  I tried Amazon and found what I was looking for and at a great price!  I couldnt wait to get them.  They arrived on time and were packaged perfectly to protect them from damage.  It has been overcast the last few days, but I have still worn them just to get the feel of them.  Cheap sunglasses feel crooked on my nose.  It feels like one part of the frame is touching my eyebrow and the other isn\\'t.  These sunglasses fit perfectly and are not bulky or gawdy at all.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a designer pair of glasses at a great price!', 2111: \"I ordered these pair of glasses because my half jacket silver with iridium lenses (silver frame with light blue lenses) is showing its age. I got a whisker type Oakley as a gift last Christmas but feel that I enjoy the plastic versions better. I got them from the mail today and so extremely satisfied with it. I picked the rootbeer color with same color frame and gold emblem. It fits my face perfectly and I like the new color. The lenses are great but I'm still getting used to the rootbeer lens color. I'm asian and these glasses are snug, they really hug my face and they are very light. You really have to pick the style that fits your face in order to really be satisfied with the Oakley glasses. So far I have 4 Oakleys including a frame for my prescription glasses.I was a Ray Ban guy but I like Oakleys better. Great quality glasses, would buy again.\", 2112: \"While on vacation to Myrtle Beach I lost one nose pad while swimming in the ocean. Yes, I love these glasses so much and because I had the lenses prescription made I wore them even in the ocean. To finish out my vacation I took the other nose pad off so I could still wear them. Even with no nose pads I quickly discovered my Oakley's were still remarkably comfortable. However, they rested lower on my face. When I returned home I had my ophthalmologist order new nose pads that I easily installed myself.I didn't like it. With the pads they fit too high. By accident I discovered that without the nose pads they fit much better, feel and look better and are just as comfortable. Give it a try. Remove the pads and test it out on your face. You'll see it's much better. If you don't like it that way they can easily be reattached.\", 2113: 'If you have to replace the rubber pieces, (the nose piece has a tendency to fall off and you have to get a whole kit to replace,) it can be difficult. After struggling to replace the ear piece rubber with I used a drop of dishwashing soap in the ends and they slid right on. They were initially stretched a bit but they conformed. The installation of the lenses take some time to master.', 2114: 'He loves these glasses.  Was actually a replacement purchase for another set of Half Jackets he lost in a mountain bike race.  Work great while biking and look great on him as well!', 2115: \"I ordered these glasses because I like the look, but they ended up too small for my face. The shipper was willing to give me a refund because of the bad fit, but in the end I decided to give them to my younger brother who has a smaller, narrower head than me. They look fantastic on him. But if you have a larger head, particularly if it's round, these glasses will look goofy on you.\", 2116: \"Just got my Half Jacket in the mail today. Didn't research and assumed that the XLJ was the standard, rounded lens, which is what I was trying to get. The way it's shown on the Amazon add, the XLJ is the standard lens and the regular half jacket is the other one.  WRONG! Fortunately I'm comfortable with XLJ model so I'm keeping it but totally understand John's frustration.  Amazon needs to clean up the ad.  Check out this website to know which lens is which. One thing, can't complain about the price.  Over $60 off retail and no shipping for this order. Product is clean and came within 2 weeks of purchase.\", 2117: 'Oakley M FramesAccording to some sites, Oakley had release three different types of M Frame glasses over the years. The originals debuted in the early 1990s, then were revised around 2000, and the latest came out in 2006 (M Frame 2.0). The M Frames I used were purchased from Oakley\\'s Standard Issue program, the same place where I get M Frame 2.0\\'s. The M Frames use the same lenses as the M Frame 2.0, except the 2.0 requires a drill out in the center of the lens for the special clip. The M Frame itself has a tighter fit around the temples, and arcs out a lot more at the corners, which can create interference issues with helmets and straps. The M Frame 2.0 is a flatter and larger/looser fit.The M Frame 2.0 have very limited lens choices: clear, VR28, and gray. These M Frame \"1.0\" have a wider variety of lenses with different tints: Strike, Hybrid, Hybrid Small, Heater, and Sweeper. I purchased the Hybrid Small with a Black Iridium lens coating to reduce glare. The VR28 on my M Frame 2.0 was great in any condition other than heavy sunlight and sunlight reflecting off water or wet pavement.The M Frames I test fitted at a mall were extremely tight, so I suspect the M Frames I bought from the Oakley SI program are slightly newer.If you don\\'t mind limited lens choices, the M Frame 2.0 is more rugged due to the center clip. That said, the M Frame 1.0 is well regarded by cyclists and Soldiers for eye protection. The M Frame 1.0 has a lot more options for lenses, although you could just remove the clip from the 2.0 and use the same lenses.Overall: 4/5 stars', 2118: \"These things look good, feel good and are worth the price.  I normally don't spend a lot of money on myself, but I'm glad I did for these!\", 2119: \"I have got to say, these are fantastic! I am a die hard Dodgers fan and have Dodger's merchandise up the wazoo. When I found out that Oakley made sunglasses that were tailed to your favorite MLB team I jumped right on them. My inital concern before taking delivery of these were that the lense area might be a bit too large but after taking delivery of these my concerns were put to rest. These sunglasses are stunningand the Dodgers blue and white colors are stylish and impressive. I have an average size head so these fit like a glove however my buddy tried them on (his head is a bit smaller) and they did not look as good. So if fit is problem I would try on a pair at your local Sunglass Hut before buying. Overall I am extremely pleased with these and out of the 6 pairs of Oakleys I own, these are now my #1's!\", 2120: 'I like it..it totally fits..the design looks good even the fitting.I highly recommend this Oakley..even though its not polarized but its worth it.', 2121: 'I love this glasses, their lenses are so smooth and clear, they really protect from the UV radiation. also Flak Jacket glasses are so comfortable.', 2122: 'They were every thing that I had expected and are better than I expected.  They are very cool and usefull in many situations.', 2123: \"Pros:I use the Basic Black model and wrap arounds for protection Exceeds ANSI Z87.1 standards for impact and optical requirements (basic safety glasses req) Has different lenses and colors for custom configurations.  Wrap around fit and style for smaller faces.  Flat ear pieces so if you wear for shooting purposes, they fit flat under active hearing protection and remain comfortable for extended use.  Heavy solid duty construction and fit- very easy to clean and maintain.I have them in Black, Olive Tortoise, Translucent Light Desert Brown.  They wrap around very nicely.  The Olive Tortoise are older models and actually look black until you get in strong sunlight that shows they are like a camouflage blend.  Get the Polarized lenses for these sunglasses as they cut the glare nicely.Cons:  None, a solid performer for your money.Conclusion:  If you want a good set of wrap around shades for motorcycling / shooting / active wear, these fit the bill rather nicely.  You can buy others for safety wear that are throw aways, I've never had a problem with my Oakley's and unless you sit on them by putting them in your back pocket, they will last.  If you want some cheap decent throw away's, look at the Smith and Wesson mini-mags in clear or black lenses.  They fit smaller faces and look better than the Wiley's.  I like my Oakley's and Smith mini's throw away's for eye protection.\", 2124: 'The pair of sunglasses I got were real.  You should always check your product especially on high end items like this to make sure they are not knock offs.The pair I got were 100% real.

So much clearer than the cheaper shades I had. Hoping to get another pair as a back up.', 2128: \"very comfortable and good looking sunglasses. I give it 4 stars because the one they sent me it was not &#34;asian fit&#34; but it's OK because they fit well thought.\", 2129: 'Very nice and comfortable glasses, had the half jacket and these are far more superior than those. Especially for playing sports it just stays on like part of you.', 2130: \"I'm not Asian, but I do have a big wide head. These are the only quality shooting glasses I could find that fit. These glasses are so light and clear that I forget I am wearing them.I had found some inexpensive glasses that fit, the the optics were bad and affected aiming. So I bit the bullet and bought the Oakleys. I have since bought two more pair and several different lens tints and shapes.These are well worth the money.\", 2131: \"HEY! YO! DON'T BE A CLOWN!

Furthermore the best design that help and comfort people who wearing it.', 2138: 'Oakley Bottlecaps are the best sunglasses I have ever owned.  The simple styling works great for all settings and these are very durable.As a football coach, one of my players kicked a football that connected with my face about 10 yards away...the glasses took the brunt of the impact and flew about 10 yards in the air.  After I remembered my name, I tracked down the glasses and sure enough, NO DAMAGE. My face had a bruise imprint of the laces, but the glasses were fine.  That was 10 months ago and I just ordered my second set of lenses this week (because I wanted to upgrade to polarized).These have my highest recommendation!', 2139: \"Love these sunglasses!!!!! I like them even more than my Oakleys with the rubber ear socks. Very comfortable. I have a relatively thin face and they fit perfectly. Even with Super Saver shipping they still arrived in 2 days. Couldn't be happier with them.\", 2140: 'Extremely light and stable frame and very cool. Lenses are great in most kinds of light. I think these glasses are discontinued and I should buy an extra pair or two for my old age.', 2141: 'The frame itself is fantastically light and a great fit. The lenses tend to be rather unforgiving though when it comes to body oils, gels, sweat - smearing and constant re-cleaning is a habitual ritual now that I own a pair. Overall I do like the glasses, but not 100% sure I would buy the same as a replacement if my current pair was attacked by ninjas.', 2142: 'Easy to scratch though ( like most glasses ). Difference is that it shows very clearly on the iridium lens...', 2143: 'The colors and design for this signature series makes my frogskins stand out from the rest.

Great buy.\", 2149: \"It's hard to find sunglasses that are fun, look good and are very lightweight on my face. Having had my nose broken twice, the bridge is pretty sensitive to weight. I love these and they are now my everyday go to glasses.\", 2150: \"I had been looking at the Frogskins for a while, and finally found them at the best price here. The fit and finish are as expected, pretty good, and the plastic looks and feels high-quality. My only complaint is that the lenses themselves are quite a bit more violet than the look like in the pictures, which I was not expecting. I was hoping for a more reddish tint. I was thinking about returning them for this reason, but everyone seems to think they look very well on me and I've grown used to the violet hue. Overall, they look very cool, feel great, and are certainly different. I very much recommend them.\", 2151: 'These are fly as f!@#. Durable, light,  nice lens. I literally stepped on mine by accident, and i was able to snap all the parts back in together and put them back on, not even a scratch on the lens.

I've wore them around and they are a perfect fit. I've always went to oakley for sunglasses and they never do me wrong.\", 2155: \"These glasses look awesome - from the outside, the violet iridium looks great and the matte black frames are a nice touch.  Now from the inside, the lenses have a strong bronze tint to them, which I am assuming helps out with contrast.  Certain greens seem to 'pop' out against other colors.  Another unique feature of lenses is that the outer edges of the lenses seem to be darker (or greener) than the center, which may take a little time to get used to.\", 2156: \"Oakley's are hard to beat for the feel.

I love them, they are my favorite ones I have ever owned and most expensive too.. Which makes me cherish them a little too for my pocket.Wearing these glasses, everyone loves them. My friends and family love them. All my friends in college were saying they wanted these as their next pair. They are classic, they are Oakley, and the purple lens is beautiful with the black frame.  Everyone loves them from what I know. I love wearing them all the time I go out when the Carolina sun is beating down.The only downside is they are plastic, not a metal frame or aluminum or something more sturdy.  The plastic hinges can wear out and you will have to tighten them with a eye-glass kit probably. I know thats a hassle no one wants to do really, but these are glasses that need to have a good maintenance on them.If you care about how you look and how the product works and taking very good care of your glasses, then these are the ones to go for.I think for someone new to the whole Sunglass wearing, these are a great pair. I know there are better, but honestly. I'm tired of everyone talking about RayBans and hearing them in all the music we hear in todays. These are the same exact kind but some with better lenses and I had mine polarized.

I love these glasses I wear them every time I get the chance. They are perfect sunglasses. And I even sat on them a few times and the ear pieces don't snap they just come off and are easily put back onto the frame. And washing the lenses is easy just use soap and warm water and give them a quick rub with your fingers and rinse and your done. I highly recommend these glasses to everyone I talk to. And if they ever break I'm going to be getting another pair\", 2165: 'For the price is amazing the comfort and quality that Oakley offers i love Oakley i have 3 more pair of different models of Oakley', 2166: \"I have had no problem with the quality of these things.  The look sweet, they're lightweight, they're very comfortable, and come with my favorite lenses.  Why are they my favorite, you ask?  Well let me tell you.  You know that time when you're outside at a baseball game (or picnic/other leisurely summer activity), and it's a little overcast?  It's bright enough to be annoying to your naked eye but you can't quite see out to left field with sunglasses on.  These are perfect for that situation, yet somehow still manage to work well in direct sunlight, too.  Anyway, buy them.\", 2167: 'I love Oakley Frogskins, I have a crystal purple frame and decided to purchase crystal black frame. I thought the red iridium lens would be a great alternative for my Green Iridium Lens Frogskins. However when I received the glasses, the lenses were more violet than red. The images on Amazon are a bit tricky as the glasses themselves are pictured in a white background, which is true, you will get a hint of red on the edges of the lens when reflecting light off a white background but nowhere near enough as the product picture. Still I liked the see-through frame and am currently deciding on a true mirror lens replacement as these lenses are a still see-through.', 2168: 'these are same as picture with epic color of lens.everybody I met loved it.very good choice! ! !', 2169: \"Very nice build quality and i like how it fits. Classics will never die, good for 80's babies like me.\", 2170: 'I had many pairs of these years ago and always liked them. Glad to see them on amazon. I have enjoyed them again. They provide good glare protection and look sharp.', 2171: 'And, they look pretty darn good, too. I feel like they are a must for summer driving, for sure. Great!', 2172: \"Excellent product. The view thru the glass is very clean because the glass is a kind transparent so the other person in front of you can see you eyes (in case you don't want it)\", 2173: \"Great packaging, comes in a cool little microfiber glasses bag that doubles as a lens cleaning cloth.The only thing I might nit-pick is that the color in the image looks to be yellow/green-ish.  If you don't do enough research you may not know that Fire-Iridium is actually a burnt orange look.\", 2174: 'I have been wearing Costa Del Mar for 8 years now, and I have to admit the Costa lenses are far more superior. But as for style, light weight, and price tag you cant beat the Oakley Frogskins in classic black. I got more compliments in 20 minutes of wearing the Oakleys during a patio brunch, than I did the whole 8 years I wore Costa. The reflective mirror in the violet iridium lenses is the brightest I have ever owned. Thats exactly what I wanted: that late eighties early nineties classic and clean alternative look. Thank you Oakley for keeping the old hits around.', 2175: 'These are really comfortable good sunglasses.  I wear sunglasses all day and need ones that protect my eyes properly and are comfortable to wear; these are both of those.', 2176: \"I always wanted a pair of these in the 80's but unfortunely I wore glasses and could not.  Now 25 years later and after LASIK surgery I can finally wear them!  They are comfortable and easy to snap back together if you sit on them.\", 2177: \"Ordered this product after a long period of deliberation. Product was as anticipated! Amazing! usual Oakley's quality. It may be a little plasticky and light for some people, but it served me well in the hot, hot weather of Vietnam!\", 2178: 'I hate purchasing glasses online, especially expensive ones, but these sit just perfectly fine. They are so hot and seems like they will look great on everyone!', 2179: 'My favorite activewear sunnies for Runyon Canyon where everybody seems to be too cool for school. These help me fit right in without looking pretentious.', 2180: \"Great quality, fit perfect, lens seem durable and scratch resistant! I typically wouldn't go for the frogskin style but I'm very happy I did.\", 2181: 'My son bought a pair of these Oakley Frogskin sunglasses and he loved them. He wore them everyday, of coarse with his tank tops, the quality of the glasses were amazingly durable. They never broke, bent, etc. his were stolen while we were on our vacation in Puerto Rico. He loved them so much that he is going to buy his second pair of these Oakley sunglasses in white with ruby lenses.', 2182: 'Vinieron en perfecto estado, tal cual los escog&iacute;, vinieron sin estar doblados ni rallados los cristales muy satisfecho y agradecido', 2183: 'Great lenses', 2184: 'Im currently in Afghanistan and the sun is a killer. But these frog skins are the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, No glare from the sun and seems to keep my eyes covered and cool.', 2185: \"when you think frogskins you think slimy.. Well they must not of used much in these glasses its hard plastic. look great if you like the 80's look. which my boyfriend does.. the bright orange shoes and these glasses.. Complete dork.. but adorable....\", 2186: 'These are classic Oakley sunglasses --- coming in many colors but black always works best. I have owned matte black frogskins and the difference is that the polished black frame is &#34;younger&#34; in style, while the matte is always classic, timeless.', 2187: 'These were certainly a hit on Christmas Day:) My son really loves them!  Oakley has a good looking product here!', 2188: 'Love these sunglasses, the lens along with the frame are outstanding quality. Looking to buy another pair soon! More stylish than the ray ban sunglasses in my opinion.', 2189: \"I personally adore Oakley sunglasses and I have had a pair for close to 8 years now. I flung my old pair off a small cliff in Mexico by accident and still managed to find them (thank goodness) in great condition although the lenses are totally blistered now.I was extremely excited about getting the frogskins as a lighter-weight replacement; the customisability of the model is an extremely attractive option! My only problem is that the arms of the frame pop off way too easily. Compared to my hardier pair of old Oakley's, I've already had to replace my frame once for half the price I paid for them. However, I love the Frogskins to bits; they look awesome, feel awesome and as long as you treat them nicely (minus throwing them at annoying family members) they're absolute keepers.\", 2190: \"The boy likes em, now he can trully be cool with big buggy blue eyes, hope he takes care of them cause I'm never buying another pair.\", 2191: 'I really, really like these glasses...but, they felt SO cheap, and flimsy.  The fit was amazing, the colors of the lenses and frame are crisp, exactly the sunglasses I like.  But unfortunately because of the cheap construction I had to give it 4 stars and especially for the price.', 2192: 'These shades are great, very comfy! but the listing says they are polarized, which they are not. I got the Violet Iridium lenses and they are listed on the box as \"3N\" which means dark tint and Normal (non-polarized) type lenses.', 2193: 'Great pair of sunglasses.  Timeless classic that can be worn for many years to come.  Would recommend this item to all.', 2194: \"Bought this Feb 2013Using it fairly regularly though not everyday.I like them because:1. They're the exact kind of wayfarers I want, that is without the tilt of Ray Ban wayfarers.2. The color is good.3. The lens isn't too dark.4. It's lightweight.5. It's cheap here on Amazon.6. Came with a pink sunglasses Oakley cloth bag.7. Fits me right. (I'm asian but not the thin skinny type)I don't know why the other reviews say they're not durable. But I've had them for a while and they're still alive like the rest of my sunglasses. I've stored them loosely in my bag when I use them and it hasn't broken yet.Will buy more frogskins in the future.\", 2195: \"it is very light and has clear lens than others!!but it's a little large to me. so I gave 4 stars.everything is perfect as I expected.\", 2196: 'These are men glasses, but I bought them for me. The white and yellow caught my attention and they are so light. They look great on me. Plenty of compliments!!', 2197: \"Why are these called Juliets? Should've been Romeos. Cause THAT would've made them cooler.I used to drool over pricey sunglasses such as these, but at $400 I couldn't bite. The prices have come down, though, so it was finally time to buy. To think, the $100 Oakley sunglasses used to suffice, but the Juliets are a HUGE step up. They feel strong and secure, unlike any plastic kind.One complaint, though. When they fold up, they're not very compact and not something you can easily stick in your pocket. It's not because the glasses themselves are big - they're the same size as other Oakley sunglasses that DO have a tighter fold - it's just that folding them leaves a lot of space between the arms and the lenses. Therefore, you'll need a bigger case, which means you'll be filling more space in your pockets which isn't comfortable. So don't get these if you need a tight fit in your pockets.HOWEVER - Sunglass Hut makes a case that is perfect for these. Oakley, however, does not. The Sunglass Hut case is $15. The Oakley case is double that, resembles a huge sausage and is impossible to fit comfortably in your pocket.Another thing - I'm told that over time the nose plate gets loose. It's best to send back to Oakley for fixing, which will cost another $50 or so. If the screws get loose, you'll need to either take it to an Oakley store of buy a special screwdriver at the hardware store - it's not a standard screw.These glasses come with alternate nose and side shocks, a microfiber bag, and a box that has an Oakley coin on it.\", 2198: \"I have had these for just over 5 years now. Other than a few faded marks on the iridium they still look as good as when I first bought them. I never had to tighten any screws ever. They fit perfect and I have always gotten compliments on how cool I look.  I am looking for a new pair now and I just can't find another pair that comes close.  This was money well spent.\", 2199: \"Nearly 10 years ago I purchased these glasses as an upgrade from the late Oakley Romeo. They are by far my greatest investment. I had the lenses replaced with prescription fire iridium and have developed a good habit of storing them in the sort vault when not in use. The total purchase minus insurance was still well over $400 dollars but after owning prescription Romeo's I knew the cast would be worth it. The technological investment Oakley has invested into these frames and lenses are incredible.With the exception of some polishing, where they rest above my ears, they look as new as the day I purchased them nearly 10 years ago. The glasses have two brilliantly engineered hinges near the nose piece which provides much needed flexibility when putting on and taking of the the glasses. The hinges have also proved to be the perfect safe guard for accidental stress which may have otherwise compromised its rigid construction.The late Romeo style sunglasses had a big problem of cracking is lenses during normal day to day stress, Juliet's design nicely corrects this problem with two stylish hinges on each of the lower outside part of the lens casings.I am not going into any details about the lenses themselves (there are so many different options to choose from), but I will say that if I could surgically implant these fire iridium prescription lenses over my eyes I would. They stop my overly sensitive blue eyes from tearing up (even on cloudy days) during the day and are oddly non-obtrusive while driving at night.I would recommend these glasses to anyone spending a lot of time outdoors (or otherwise). I forever regret not having these sunglass during my 8 years marching in The Blue Devils Drum & Bugle Corps. When my son's face gets big enough to wear them, he will have a pair with his prescription......(don't bother coming home if you lose them Gabriel ;-)...oh, and you might enjoy they cool (Cyclops from X-Men) factor these babies have. Puts all those cheeper plastic Oakley's others parade around in to shame! =-)\", 2200: 'The price was right. These same glasses sold for almost twice as much on the Oakley website. My husband was so excited to get them. It was only possible due to the price, I was able to get them for. Thank you!', 2201: \"the frame is absolutely stunning. the lens is flawless and sexy! I've owned a pair of juliets for 5 years now (another reviewer also stated he/she owned one for 5 years as well). It's true. The frame is as durable as iridium on acid. with the amount you will spend on cheap sunglasses every year you might as well spend it on juliets. i'm just now getting ready to replace the rubber nose gaurds and ear socks for the first time since i've had it. the best thing about these sunglasses, you can buy a set of different colored lenses and change them out depending on your mood.the lens from any Oakley is heavily engineered. i think the oakley brand is the brains and innovators of the industry. you will obtain the highest amount of visibility without any glare, nor will any objects become distorted. it's pretty hard to scratch the lenses unless it was a freak accident or intentional. it's no wonder other companies want to imitate their patented design/colors. simply beautiful.keep in mind the juliets are heavier than your average set of sunglasses. actually, you won't even notice it. they're as comfortable as a workaholic finally getting to sleep in on a saturday morning.i'm not trying to sell this product. i am just an ordinary person who has made the leap over from conventional sunglasses to oakleys.\", 2202: 'These are a very good set of sun glasses, if you can get past the price these sunglasses fit very well and have good field of view.', 2203: 'Beautiful sunglasses  I love it and the good thing with this sunglasses is the lenses is replaceable i ordered black polarized lenses and its looks great.', 2204: 'Arrived in time, great glasses, solid frame, the colors looks very naturals and enhanced, very comfortable for me. I really recomend this product.', 2205: 'lightweight, comfortable, very happy with purchase. the actual shade of glass is more of a very dark amber and does not fully hide your eyes from the outside, but overall they are very nice.', 2206: 'these oakley\\'s are worthy of a 5 star rating. they look and feel great. I have a large head, 7 3/4\" and they are easy to adjust for a great fit!', 2207: 'The frame is big but the balance is very good, the optics are excellent, but needs to work in the rubber in the tip of the arms', 2208: \"I like-d the glasses. My head may be a bit on the big size because when I woudl wear them for extended periods of time they would hurt the area above my ears. 5-6 hours. If I do get another pair I'll be sure to try or make sure that they are a bit bigger to ensure comfort.\", 2209: 'These Oakleys are a great deal.  Purchased them and they fit great on me (might not work for someone with a smaller face).  Price is reasonable and they are sturdy wear them everywhere and they hold up to a busy lifestyle.  Would highly recommend for anyone.', 2210: \"Bought a pair at the O store and they were stolen. I almost broke down. I absolutley loved those shades. Well, I had to buy another pair. If you're gonna buy sunshades, you gotta get polarized.\", 2211: \"As soon as I opened the box and felt them, I knew I just made the best sunglasses purchase I have ever made. They make me feel a rockstar. The style is great. Within 100 feet of walking out my door I got a compliment on them. PERFECT and I'm not regret at all ,love the vr28 lens polorized .only negative is a little bit tight becouse it has sport design.\", 2212: 'The size of these glasses are ideal for medium face sizes, and vision coverage is great, plus the polarized lens makes these glasses in an excellent article, liviadas and stylish, they can be used with a sporty, casual or formal.', 2213: 'These sunglasses are perfect for hikers looking to make a fashion statement.  Not only are they great protection from the sun, but they radiate a coolness that just ups your confidence right away.  Their only drawback is that they are a bit heavy, a small price for the general awesomeness they give to your life.', 2214: 'These are an awesome pair of sunglasses it fits well and looks great. It has a rugged look to it. It worth the price.', 2215: 'These shades are great I love them. this was the only place that actually still have them. They are a little pricey but well worth it.', 2216: 'Pros:- The lens polarization is amazing- The mirrored coating on the lens hides your eyes well even in direct sunlight.- The lenses wrap around your eyes well so that they cover your peripheral vision.- Rubber tipped stems keep the glasses in place nicely.Cons:- The nose pieces leave marks on your nose if worn for an extended period of time- Glasses do not come with caseI recommend that you try these glasses on before buying them as they can be too big for some face shapes.', 2217: \"I would first like to confess that I have not had these sunglasses for a long period of time, but from the first time I put them on, I knew they were a cut above the rest of the sunglasses I have owned.  While these are not my first pair of expensive sunglasses, they are my first Oakleys and I am impressed. While a little on the heavy side (read: made with durable, quality materials), these glasses look great and draw compliments.  Whether you prefer Aviator or Square Lens style sunglasses, these should be aesthetically pleasing to/for your eyes.  Pictures don't accurately convey the size of these frames, but while they are certainly robust, I would be hesitant to call them huge.  I liked these so much, I bought the same style in Polished Gold/Gray.  The difference between polarized and non-polarized lenses is barely noticeable in my opinion, so I don't believe it justifies the difference in price, hence the loss of one star.\", 2218: \"I have made many purchases on Amazon but this is the first time I have felt compelled enough to write a review. These shades are the truth!!!! They feel great on (and I have a big head) and feel durable. I have received many compliments on these shades. If you are on the fence about getting these.....go ahead and do it. You won't be sorry!!!!\", 2219: 'Strongly recommend these glasses. But try them before the purchase since they are quite big. They actually do not fit into the Oakley case I bought separate.', 2220: 'Product showed up on time if not early, and packaged securely. Couldn\\'t be more impressed with the glasses either. Awesome design and perfect condition, these glasses are exactly what I\\'ve been looking for. I hit the Oakley Store and a couple Sunglass Huts earlier this week and both either didn\\'t have them or insisted I wouldn\\'t be able to find this particular model. Thanks to Oakley online and Amazon, not only did I find the exact pair of sunglasses I was looking for (and at a better price, saved over $50)but was able to purchase easily and not feel as though a wasted a decent amount of cash settling on \"just what\\'s available\". Definitely check here first in the future!', 2221: 'These arrived in smashed packaging but right on time.  We were worried that they would be crushed, but they looked just fine.  My husband has a very stronge square shaped chin and they look so good on him.', 2222: \"They are perfect and comfortable, besides the red details make the whole difference if you're looking for something a little flashy, Ducati is written on the left lens adding a little more sportiveness to them. The frame won't be on your ray of vision and it's really easy to adjust to your temples by bending gently.\", 2223: 'I love these glasses. They are very light so you barely feel them, and they stay on when you bend down to tie your shoes, etc.', 2224: 'This is a very nice pair of glasses.  The tint is perfect, the shape is perfect.  It looks exactly like it does in the picture.  I wear them in both proffesional attire and when I go out to party.  One of the best pair of sunglasses I have owned for a very reasonable price.', 2225: 'Lentes increibles, se ajustan perfectos, super ligeros, parecen que van a resistir un buen tiempo, y el precio mejor que muchas tiendas tipo Macys o DIllards, los recomiendo.', 2226: 'I originally got these sunglasses as a prescription directly from oakley. They have been through several sets of prescription lenses over the past 5 years. I wore them for driving and cycling. I have a vast collection of non prescription sunglasses and these are by far my favorite. I am not as happy using these for cycling due to the small lens size, I personally like a larger lens when I cycle.Just finished Lasik and have decided to replace the prescription lenses with a 3rd party polarized lens (eBay) rather than switch to another pair of glasses. I have not been kind to these and the frames are holding up well. I am buying a second pair just in case. I cant say enough about these glasses. Highly recommended.', 2227: \"I've owned Oakleys in the past (two pairs of Zeros 3.0) and loved everything about them. One was stolen and the other I accidentally broke with my face. I won't get into details but it took a lot of force and a slight concussion. Anyhow these are just as good if not better in my opinion. They're light weight, well made and designed, and fit fantastically. I will admit, a lot of their designs look cheap and feel cheap. These are not cheap in the slightest. It would be nice if they came with a case but I won't dock a star for that, especially since I got them on sale here for 50 bucks less.\", 2228: 'Excellent quality, I bought these for my wife and she love it, she felt her eyes relax. And she love the way it looks.', 2229: \"They are perfect glasses for any occasion, durable, and very nice looking. Almost two year with them, and they're still in great conditions. Even at work, they don't scratch easily.\", 2230: \"I love these.  Just got them.  Vision is awesome, great in light.  I'm a woman and it's a tight fit which is good for me.  But since they are for men probably not best choice if you have a wider face, they are definitely made for a smaller frame.  They kind of have a retro look to them and they are different, you can't even really tell their Oakleys.\", 2231: 'I bought these for my husband as a birthday gift. He really wanted them and being that they have been discontinued in stores, I was glad to find them online. He absolutely loves them. Very happy!!', 2232: 'Its a simple and basic sunglasses. The lens are very good. The \"one size fits all\" realy fits all.', 2233: 'We bought these glasses for my 14 year old son. He LOVES them. They fit very well (he is a good size kid). They look awesome.', 2234: \"I use these with the iPhone 3GS and they rock!.Stereo bluetooth sounds great.  The sound is missing a bit in the low end, but that is to be expected since these are not in-ear buds.  Sound overall is nice:  not tinny, perfect stereo, but does tend to crackle on high bass music.  Earbuds would have been nice with this, but the earphones it has fit niceley in the ears.The glasses themselves are very comfortable and feel like I can wear them all day without the punched-nose look from the bridge pads.  Be careful the lenses scratch easily!  Overall the glasses are constructed solid and not cheap-feeling.  Glasses are a nice tight fit too and won't fall off your face when leaning down or fast head movements.The bluetooth function is great.  No unexpectd loss in signal.  Range is a bit weak, but I don't know if it's due to the iPhone range or a combination.  For me, the music starts to skip from signal loss at around 15ft.  Not a deal-breaker by any means as I never leave my phone that far away as to forget it.  I can't speak for other bluetooth phones, but the bluetooth works about flawlessly with the iPhone.  Only thing I couldn't get to work is the track forward/reverse buttons, but again, it could be the iPhone handling this.  Battery life is pretty decent.  I'm pretty sure I can go all day with a charge on these glasses listening to music for a few hours during that time.  I haven't cracked open the glasses to see what kind of battery it has for when it starts to not hold a charge anymore.  But I have had these for a year now and charge is still holding.  Hopefully the battery is not proprietary, but I get the feeling it is.Lastly, clarity of speaker and mic are great.  People never hear an echo and always hear me clearly - even with car windows down doing 60.  There is plenty of volume on the speakers to hear people clearly - even with the windows down doing 60.  Very fewpeoples phones however are just soft sounding so I ask them to speak up.Only drawback is the price.  I wouldn't pay over $100 for these as the bluetooth device itself should only cost $10 at most.  But since it is integrated into the glasses, Oakley brand at that, the price is steep.  I got mine as a present - but what a great gift for someone you really care about!I was going to rate these glasses at 4 stars, but for the few limitations, the enjoyment factor clearly outweighs them.\", 2235: 'my item was exactly like the seller says, the price was better than the price in stores, the shippment was so quick...Excelent purchase', 2236: 'Had the original Oakley Thump for 5 years.This is a great improvement:1.  Sound quality is alot better2.  Being able to remove the speakers when not in use is great.3.  Integrated buttons give a sleeker look as opposed to buttons on the top of the frameThe big frame might not suite people with a smaller face tho.', 2237: \"My first pair of Oakley sunglasses.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well they fit my face. I really like that the Abandon style is not too thick, plasticky, or bulky looking.  I have a small face, and RayBans tend to look too boxy on the sides and sometimes slide down my nose a lot.  I love how the Oakleys curve around the temple area.  And it's really cool that even though the earpieces are not curved at the ends, these glasses stay put and don't budge.  These are also my first pair of polarized sunglasses.  I like how they look dark when someone is looking straight at me (or when I look in the mirror), but when they are on, seeing through the lenses is not too dark.  And the images are crystal clear.  I would definitely buy another pair!\", 2238: 'Im a Bass fishermen and need polarized lenses on the water. The split thumps have some very nice lenses that fit the bill. Ive always had problem with MP3 players and the wires. The wires are just a pain to deal with and seem to always get in the way. With the split thumps theres no problems at all. I think Ive used these glasses more then any Ive ever owned. I use them while cutting the lawn, working on the car ect. When you dont want the ear phones just unplug them and you have a normal pair of glasses. I think Oakley hit the nail on the head with these! Thanks!', 2239: 'Beautiful glasses, high quality, arrived well on time in perfect condition, were to gift my family is very happy with these glasses, high quality accessories, it hurts not sell more, very nice, very very satisfied with my purchase', 2240: 'Like so many people had said, it get fogged a little bit. But the really protect you from sun, looks very sporty.', 2241: 'Great deal! I was afraid they would look a little bit too wide on my face, but it turns out they fit just fine!', 2242: \"These glasses feel real sturdy, and the lenses seem good.However, they didn't quite fit my face.  They felt good around my head (7 1/4 hat size), but they didn't sit on my nose right.  There was a small gap around the bridge of my nose that let light in, so I had bright spot in the middle of my field of vision.I've returned them, and I'll select another pair of Oakley glasses.  These are made in the US and seem well made.\", 2243: 'Very good glasses from Oakley. This is not a polarized unit because the last unit that I had polarized I faced many issues with the lens peeling off.', 2244: 'Excellent product, very recommended!The design and the features of the product are really good follow the sport style of Bruce irons!', 2245: \"There is not a lot to say about Oakley products, very good all the ones I've had.

Great pair of glasses.Thanks,', 2249: 'I love this sunglasses!!!I use every sunny day. This model in particular is perfect to my face.It is a quality product of Oakley', 2250: 'i bought these shades because i was looking for several things: 1. protection from glare 2. a lightweight frame and 3. a good and snug fit. i have to say oakley got high marks on all three categories. i would definitely recommend them for casual use.', 2251: 'I just bough this model, and i just like it a lot, great protection, great look...', 2252: 'My husband had lost his favorite sunglasses similar to this pair. His comment was that these fit even better than the pair he lost. The sides prevent sun from coming in at the sides. The style is very current and attractive.

I live in Arizona, where the sun shines 300 days a year. Love them!\", 2267: \"I love the color of these glasses.  I literally use them everyday.  I've had problems with some of my past Oakleys where they would constantly slide off of my head and I would have to constantly adjust them to make them stay on.  With these ones, they actually have some curvature so they wrap around my head and I don't have to worry about them falling off.  I even took them white water rafting and didn't have to worry about them.  I've dropped them several times and they still look like they're fairly new.  On top of that, its nice because the lenses block out enough light without making the entire scenery seem excessively dim.

When I saw this model here with its very awesome price, I went to a nearby mall so I could see and try it myself. Truth be told, the Hijinx is ASTIG (local street term for tough/cool) and looked really durable. And the price is almost triple of that of Amazon! Jeez! Tho it's itsy bitsy big for my medium face, I thought I still looked great in them. I went home rightaway to hit checkout here. It's now in the hands of my former assistant who's vacationing in Manila early December. Excited! I will buy another Oakley model again next year in time for her next vacation!\", 2273: \"I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He hasn't opened his present yet, but I know he will love these.

They are stunning and a great price.\", 2274: \"I've had mine for two years, had them fitted with polarized prescription lenses, and dropped them several times.

I have a medium-to-large somewhat oval face and they fit perfectly and look classy. I much prefer the crystal frame because it gives an open feel by letting some light through, compared to.black frames which make you feel closed off, like wearing goggles. The clarity is typical Oakley - exceptional. Not too dark, not too light. I've been wearing these for several years and bought these as a backup pair. Best sunglasses I've ever owned.\", 2278: 'These are made for guys that have medium plus or large heads.  I had a friend with a small head try them on and it looked rediculous.  They are loose fitting which is what I like so enjoy them or for a slightly tighter fit you should go with the GasCan model.  Excellent quality!', 2279: \"What a great pair of sunglasses...Oakley comes through.  These are extremely lightweight and well vented (No Fogging).  They provide supurb protection all around.

He has a large head and I was worried because he is picky with sunglasses but he loves them and they fit him great.  He used to be one to go through a few pair of $5-10 sunglasses a year but since getting Oakleys he says they are worth it and he don't lose them anymore.Update 1/28/12My husband still loves his sunglasses but he said they are not nearly as comfortable of a fit as his other Oakleys but I only paid in the $60s for these whereas to buy an exact replacement for the ones he already has, they would have been around $130.\", 2291: \"very comfortable and light lenses, sometimes I forget that I wear, the quality of vision even in open angle is optimal, I'm happy with my purchase...\", 2292: 'These pair was a steal at the $58 price  tag.

Thank you.', 2322: \"I love this style of Oakley's.  I am writing this in April of 2013 and I have had the same pair of Monster Dogs since 1998.  I end up getting new lenses about once per year because I scratch them, but replacement lenses are not as much as new glasses, so this system works for me.  I have a leash on my sunglasses, so often they are around my neck.  They also flip up onto my head nicely.  I have very long hair, so I love that these glasses don't have the separate nose pieces attached to a wire. The nose piece on my Monster Dogs is blended into the construction of the frame, so the glasses slide off my head and back onto my face without pulling a bunch of my hair with them.  I love these glasses.  I hate to hear they are discontinued, but the Straitjackets are a lot like the Monster Dogs, so if I ever can't find any more black iridium replacement lenses, then I will switch out to Strait Jackets or the Batwolfs.  Both are great looking glasses that would also work well for me.\", 2323: 'Had a pair that I loved till I lost them 3 years ago.

I have worn Oakleys for years and the only reason they fail me is because I end up losing them or I break them! haha  But that is not a demarit on their part!

I'm picky about glasses and am completely satisfied with these!\", 2327: 'With the Monster Dogs being phased out by Oakley I wanted to pick these up while still could.

They are incredebly the best that i have ever wore and no lenses can be compared with them plus the design and high optical quality.

Very confortable and light they are plus the sharp and undistorted view they provide.Once again, Congratulations to you guys!Regards,Marcio Moreira (Santo Andre - SP, Brazil)', 2343: 'I have always been happy with Oakley Sunglasses and these were no exception.  They are light, form fitting and keep the sun out.', 2344: 'I am amazed with the clarity of the lenses. When worn, the only thing that changes is the amount of light entering the eyes, there is no distortion whatsoever.

I've been looking for a good pair of sunglasses for the past few years, yet nothing looked and felt right enough to stop my search until I found these.

They do an excellent job of UV protection and shielding your eye from any glare. They are extremely durable, exemplified when I took a softball to the side of my face. One side of the glasses popped out but easily went back in. Not a scratch or anything, and I still have an intact eye socket. The only problems I have with these glasses is that they tend to fog up/get sweaty around the lens fairly often which can be annoying.

The Iridium lenses are still scratch free after one year wearing them. Lastly, the price point was the major selling point for me. Great value', 2391: 'Very fashionable and stylish. Fits perfectly, not too small frame and not big at all. Lenses are clear and provide excellent protection.MUST BUY', 2392: 'My husband loves these sunglasses. He wears them when he rides his Harley. The only thing he said is that they sometime let air in on the sides when riding on the interstate roads.', 2393: 'I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He loves the way they fit and they look great on him. I recommend!', 2394: 'I have several of the Oakley sunglasses model and this is definitely one of their most affordable while best protection model. This is my second pair :)', 2395: \"I chose this rating because I really like these sunglasses. I've lost them now, but while I had them they were great. These sunglasses are just the right size and durable.\", 2396: \"I love these sunglasses.  They are exactly as advertised and I didn't have any problems with the delivery.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to look cool!!!!\", 2397: 'I bought this because I had a version of the oakley 5 that had rounder lens and I really liked it. The one I recieved was more of a square lens. I was disappointed at first but then look in the mirror and it looked good on me so it worked out.Dont know if maybe it was an older oakley 5 that had the rounder lense but both are good.', 2398: \"Bought these for my hubby's bday.  He loved them.  Very well made, excellent sunglasses.  Liked the size, not too huge on the face.  Quite a great price vs the Oakley web or store.\", 2399: 'Probably one of the best pair of sunglasses I have ever owned !!! Nothing else needs to be said.', 2400: \"These are excellent sunglasses.  Especially like the color of the lens.  Brightens your view at the same time lessening the glare from the sun.The only thing is they are not iridium as it says in the description of the item.  Irridium gives it a light mirror coating and these don't have that.The description needs to be changed.I've had 5 pairs of Oakley sunglasses prior to these.  They are very good sunglasses.  I'll keep wearing and buying Oakleys.\", 2401: 'This is my second pair of Oakley sunglasses (I have a pair of polarized Square Wire 2.0), and I also have a pair of prescription glasses that I really like too. The reason why I bought these is because I wanted a pair that fit more closely to my face and would keep sun from coming over the top of them. They\\'re sturdy and work really well; you can even wear them inside and see fairly well if you want to be \"that guy\". I really like this pair and will definitely stay with Oakley.', 2402: 'needed some nice glasses for a decent price since i have a problem with loosing my sunglasses and of all the research i did these seem to be the best for my budget and quality and i wasnt wrong, have had these for a long time now and i love them so much i make sure i have them with me always, only when its sunny of course and have managed not to loose them', 2403: 'My wife bought these for golfing and biking. They allow enough airflow to keep her face dry, but restrict enough so her eyes out.', 2404: 'Great Oakley sunglasses fit perfect. close to face. meet typical Oakley standards. great sunglasses for athletes or for everyday wear', 2405: \"I bought these for my sister and she loves them! They are perfect for running, which is what she uses them for. I'm sure they would be great for many other activities as well.\", 2406: \"First pair of Oakley's. Always used Serengeti in the past. Good optics, nice clarity. These lenses do not have much darkness to them. They seem to work fine in bright sunshine even in the AZ summer sunshine.\", 2407: 'I purchased them to use while playing golf.  They are great making the golf course look clear and bright.  I would purchase them again.', 2408: 'as advertised very light and sleek, great vision on the golf course.extra nose guards, nice case and cleaning cloth, thanks', 2409: 'Wanted to try playing without my bifocals and needed something to cut the glare. Glasses worked fine (comfortable, etc.), but I just could live without my cheaters, so I gave them to my son.', 2410: 'literally playing with rose coloured glasses on.These glasses have good airflow which is very important in terms of fog etc. I have a gigantic blimpish head and they are flexible enough to comfortably fit.The best part about these glasses is that they are tinted with some sort of shade that interacts with the green grass and helps you see topography more clearly (ie read the greens better)', 2411: 'These are the best sunglasses my husband ever had...He absolutely loves them...The vision is great...the fit is perfect and comfortable...I would order again...came in a timely fashion.', 2412: 'I have tried four different types of sun glasses for golf.  These where the best I have found.  Highly recommended.  Considering getting a darker shade of lens.', 2413: \"I bought these glasses specifically for golf because my current glasses kept on falling off my head and didn't provide very good ability to see the ball in flight. These glasses definitely stay on really well and also I believe increase the contrast that you can see the ball better in flight. They don't provide much sun protection as far as the brightness, but I guess they provided UV protection which is important. I'm considering buying the accessory polarized lenses so I can use them in everyday use and provide better sun protection. Otherwise I think these glasses do exactly what they're supposed to witches help you see better when you're golfing.\", 2414: \"These are the best lenses for golf I've ever used. I've owned multiple Oakley frames and lenses, Maui Jims, and Ray Bans. I love the frames they wear well, are much tougher than they appear or would leave you to believe. The lenses are fantastic. I've used polarized(good for fishing, bad for golf), amber transistion lenses, and practically every color you can imagine, all with more cons than positives when it comes to the varied conditions in which you play golf. You can't read greens,(flip up on your head), can't follow the ball beyond 30yds, too dark, too light, ect. Now in contrast these are by far the most effective at allowing you to read greens without flipping them up on your head(you forget you have them on), allow for tracking of the ball in all light conditions, and can take the noon time intense sunlight. The lens size and shape keeps glare away and light from streaking in the side. I don't know how anyone could be disappointed in these. Highly would recommend to anyone.\", 2415: 'I have always bought Maui Jim but these Oakley glasses are better.  I play golf in them, and can see the golf ball better than with any other glasses I have ever had.', 2416: \"Awesome glasses.  Oakley got this one right. Can't claim it took strokes off my golf score but it does improve how you see the course.  It helps in following the ball. I can actually see were the ball lands now which was a problem before. I can say I'm loosing less balls. Very clear vision with these babies, excellent optics. Best thing; I look way cool with them. Okay, just my opinion at this time.\", 2417: \"I'm a 2 handicap competitive golfer tired of buying cheap to moderate priced glasses hoping they would work. Cheaper glasses are either blurry, distort vision, fall off my head, don't provide full coverage or break and scratch easily. Finally I ponied up and got the best and I couldn't be happier. With the G30 XLJ lens in the Flak Jacket frame these are the perfect pair of sunglasses for me. Everything looks more vibrant. I can easily see contrast and the lens helps, not hinder my green reading. They fit so well I forget I have them on and while playing golf I never take them off. The lens extends down my face far enough that I don't see the bothersome line at the bottom of the lens.Simply awesome. I bought my 17 year old son a pair after using mine for one round.\", 2418: \"I love these for golf.  They're not to dark and not to light.  You can still read the greens with them on.  They do a great job of protecting your eyes - mine feel much more rested with them on.  Oakley is extremely high quality.  Oakley makes many different styles; so try these on at a mall to make sure they fit your head and face - then go for it.  You won't be sorry.\", 2419: 'Glasses are light and comfortable. Lenses make everything look sharp. The xlj lenses are lower on your face so they let less light through to distract you when golfing.', 2420: 'These are the only sunglasses that I have been able to golf with.  They are not too dark, but still protect the eyes on bright sunny days.  I can read the greens much better with these glasses on than no glasses on.  This is true on sunny and overcast days.  They are very comfortable and do not slip while swinging the club.', 2421: \"I've had theXLJ's for a couple of weeks now. I got them for golf. The G30 lenses really make a difference. You can see the ball clearly when it's going through the air. The lenses block out blue light spectrum and have some sort of coating on them (not sure if it's anti glare) but they weigh nothing and are comfortable to wear all day on the course.\", 2422: \"These golf sunglasses are exactly as advertised. They are light, fit comfortably and are distortion free. I've used them for my last four rounds of golf and can recommend them to others.\", 2423: \"These sunglasses definitely are not fake and are the real deal. The flak jacket frames are lightweight, comfortable, and fit perfectly. On the other hand, the G30 XLJ lenses have a few cons. Although it provided great vision with no glare and no depth perception problems, I was not a fan of the pinkish tint and the shape of the lens. The XLJ means the lenses are bigger, and in my case the lenses touched my cheeks a little, but that's just my face and maybe it will fit you perfectly. Additionally, the frames may seem flimsy, they are highly durable and are flexible. They are hard to break even if you tried.Overall, these are worth every penny, and I highly suggest them to any golfer. I bought these frames with the gold iridium lenses because I hated the pink tint, and now all my problems are fixed.\", 2424: 'Very light and  comfortable.  Did not have to remove to read the greens.  Come with a nice case.  Worth the money.', 2425: \"I use these glasses for flying.  The aircraft I operate has CRT's which are hard to see when wearing most dark sunglasses and, as most commercial pilots know, polarized glasses react and impair vision through the cockpit windows.  Haze often provides challenges at lower altitudes.  These glasses seem to handle all these things quite well.  They cut through the haze, provide protection from the sun while allowing me to see the CRT's, and are not polarized.  Just wanted to share because mediocrity is frusturating!  Now if they could downsize that case so it will fit in my bag.\", 2426: \"On a friend's recommendation, I purchased these for golf- as he expressed, &#34;the color definition is unbelievable&#34;.  Well, he was right, sort of...I've found these add clarity to every condition you can throw out them- golfing, driving, yard work, etc..., imagine HD vision- it's the only way to describe it.  I wish'd I had paid extra for the polarized options, as that would have rounded out the totality of the glasses.\", 2427: \"I always go with Oakley when I need sunglasses because of the quality and when I'm wearing them I forget I have them on because they fit so well.\", 2428: 'Great pair of glasses for the money. I use them for golf here in AZ in the summer at the brightest intensity and they reveal all the undulations in the greens. They are light a fit me perfectly. Little pricey if full retail is paid.', 2429: \"I bought these for my husband and he swears by them.  Love the fit, the look and the visibility!  At first when you put them it seems like they don't work and then slowly the lighting adjusts to perfection.\", 2430: \"I can't say these galsses do anything for me in terms of golfing, like I see the greens better or something, but I am not all that great a golfer to begin with. However, they are very comfortable, I wear the glasses all round and I don;t even notice I have them on. That is rare for me with glasses. Also and more important, I know my eyes are protected from the sun because of the quility Oakley puts into the glasses. Lastly, shop around ,you won;t find them at a better price anywhere.\", 2431: \"These glasses are extremely durable. I wear them and beat them up every day. Whether you're using them for driving, running, golfing, flying. They are definitely superior quality.\", 2432: 'i use them for golf  and like them so much that I also use them for driving. they are the only pair which work for me', 2433: \"I've been looking for the perfect pair of sunglasses for golf and these Oakley's may fit the bill. During the fall and winter I've had a hard time finding my golf ball in the grass and leaves.  The rose lenses work great. I'm planning on getting a couple of other colored lenses for other activities.\", 2434: 'They are difficult to change the lenses out. Got then fit a friend as a gift. Worried the will stayed to become challenged from stretching then to changed the lenses.', 2435: 'What can be said about these sunglasses other than utterly fantastic?! I have a couple pairs of \"normal\" black iridium lens sunglasses and while on extremely bright sunny days, they work okay on the golf course, peering through shadows or any overcast proves a nuisance. The G30 lens designed for golf works wonders. I can keep them on throughout the entire round and never have an issue. The color contrasts with the green color of the course (by design) and seems to make everything pop. The ball is also much easier to track (for me) and has proved very useful in finding balls that find the leaf-covered rough here in New England. And both overcast and fading light conditions are enhanced and appear brighter than the conditions actually are. All in all, probably my favorite golf purchase of the year and that includes a new R11 driver and set of 712 AP2 irons!', 2436: \"These are really nice glasses and there is a visible difference when i look at greens with these. They don't help as much with seeing the ball in the air (which is why i got them), but i've read that different colors would work better with that (apparently brown helps with that more). You can easily buy spare lenses for these, both official and third party, so it's not really an issue. they are very light and i kind of forget that they are on after a while.two notes:- they are pink. not red, not rose, they are pink. if that's an issue don't buy them, but it does really help you see elevation and breaks better than just your eyes.- they fog. it's not anymore than normal sunglasses would, but as we get into fall it becomes more and more of an issue. they make vented versions of some of these if that's a big issue for you.\", 2437: 'The amber shades certainly amplifies the colors, but as a 200 pound guy and an avid golfer these frames do seem to  a bit big.  Seems like if I played in the wind or was putting and looking down -  that they may not fit snugly enough.', 2438: \"You never go wrong with Oakley that's why you always pay more for Oakley.Great glasses at any price this is my second pair .\", 2439: 'I bought these sunglasses for my nephew who loves the look. He stuffs them in his pockets and drops them on occasion, but they do not scratch or break. He recently wore them snowboarding and was very pleased with their performance, even though they are not polarized.', 2440: 'Very comfortable and very stylish. Good price, I saw the same sunglasses at a sunglasses store and they were 40-50 dollars more than it is here. Highly suggest them.', 2441: \"Super fast shipping, high quality authentic productI did some shopping aroundThis is the deal is the cheapest online and even cheaper that the Oakley OutletMy brother would love this for ChristmasCan't wait to give it to himHighly recommendJust perfect !\", 2442: 'The sunglasses were exactly what I wanted for my husband!

They arrived on time and in perfect condition.', 2443: 'I love these glasses, second pair I own, but they tend to fog on heavy humidity days.

The arms were grinding and flaking off the plastic at the joints. I exchanged them hoping that I just bought a lemon originally and that proved to be the case. We got the new pair and they work and look great. My husband loves them and I'm just thankful that it wasn't a classic stupid online purchase. We will be buying these again in the future.\", 2448: 'Very good fit for all types of activities.They dont bounce around your face while moving. I also love the way they block the light from the sides.', 2449: 'These are great and the yellow pops on the black.  Did not realize the Livestrong logo was on the lens.Almost returned them for this reason.', 2450: 'I have a norrower face so not a lot of sunglasses fit me very well or look good on.  The Flak XLJ fit perfectly!  Very light and comfortable.  Best of all they can be used for everything.  I use mine at the pool, running, playing golf, tennis, softball, and even while hunting.

I put my polarized lenses in these and use them primarily while motorcycling.  Again, I see my reflection off of cars sometimes and can\\'t not-think that I am trying to look cool ... how funny, I just thought white would look subtle and clean.Otherwise this model and the lenses are exceptional (however the polarized option is better and worth it)and a lifetime set if you don\\'t neglect them.

I was customizing the half jacket style in black and yellow which were going to cost $130.  I liked the style of the Flak Jacket XLJ's better than the half jacket and they were going to cost more customizing thru Oakley direct, so I decided to order the Livestrong XLJ's.  In addition to the styling these fit my face perfect.  I use these for jogging and they are not loose having the right amount of force to hold them in place.  I have another pair of Oakley's that are 10 years old, which I use for everyday casual use.  The Oakley lettering over the bridge of the nose has worn off those, but I expect that will be the same case with the Livestrong XLJ's over time.  When you clean the lens of your sunglasses the acidity on your fingers holding the glasses by the nose piece will eventually erode the lettering.\", 2467: 'These glasses are tough and look great.

He trains in Chicago, on lunch breaks, on the lake front with bright sun.

The case the glasses come in would probably withstand being run over by a car. I guess after spending this kind of money on glasses, you want them protected.

The lenses can be changed relatively easily, and they never come out unless you want them to. Their impact resistance is the stuff of legend. And most importantly, I absolutely love the VR28 lens with black iridium coating. It's a light enough tint that I don't run into a big transition problem when the light starts to get less intense, and the rose tint makes everything pop. I'm using them for Volleyball, and I couldn't be happier with them. (the only thing I would change would be to make their prescription lenses less expensive.)\", 2495: \"Ever since my days of cycling (1984) I have owned at least one pair of Oakley glasses. At the current time I now have not one but two. If I don't crash or misplace them I know they will last me for many a year.

I loved the fit of my old pair so I decided to go with the updated version.  What can I say, I love them.  They have a tight but not uncomfortable fit.  The nose and ear pads are grippy and don't lose any of it when you are sweating.  Sweat runs off the lenses pretty quick.  It's one of the things I have always liked about these glasses.  The updated look  moves the logo down to the side of the ear piece instead of up on top and it has a little spring back when you close it which is nice.  I stuck with the XLJ's because I like the coverage they give.  Less wind and dust creep in from the bottom and sides.  I have a round face so some sunglasses are too tight and give me headaches.  These fit just right.  Best of all they have a multitude of lenses for different light conditions...anywhere from clear for protection from branches and bugs and dust in lower light conditions all the way to the high end iridium lenses for max light conditions.  They even come with a hard case and extra nose pieces.  The case comes with extra slots for the additional lenses I know you're going to want to buy.  Yes Oakleys are a little pricey but if you don't lose them :), they will last you years.  If you scratch the lenses, just go out and buy another pair and pop them on the frames.  You can't go wrong with them.\", 2497: \"When I first tried on the glasses I was a bit disappointed because I thought that maybe they would not work out for me. They felt a little wide on the face, and didn't feel like they were going to be able to stay on my face while running or biking.I wore them for a workout and competition, and have been very pleased. Despite the wide feel, the glasses stayed on my face the entire time, and didn't bounce around at all.The XLJ lenses are the way to go. They flair out a little more than the normal Flak Jacket lenses, and they provide perfect protection. Any smaller lenses I would probably not have been as satisfied with.These glasses are a bit pricy, but they have held up well. I would look at these glasses as more of an investment, because they will last a long time.\", 2498: 'I collect Oakley s and I wear the Flak Jackets all the time. They are very lightweight and fit my face perfectly', 2499: \"These have definitely become my go-to set of glasses, replacing a really well loved pair that finally got dinged up enough I had to reluctantly find a replacement. I spent a little more time trying to find the right glasses than I care to admit before finding these, and I've been very happy and have no regrets. I ended up with the Livestrong version, and the yellow bands on the side and the shaped bottoms of the lenses add some style without being too obvious or garish.The great optics and light fit are the real selling points. Oakley has tremendous quality in their optics, and I'm very pleased with their performance in all manner of light conditions, from being on open water to sunny days in the mountains. No distortion in the lenses, and they have a very wide field of view. One other thing that is very positive is how they fit - they sit lightly on my face and it is easy to forget they are on. There is abundant airflow, so heat build up behind the frame is minimal and I haven't had any fogging issues. The only minor downside is that they feel a little weak; not exactly cheap, but the hinges feel a bit sticky and the light plastic frame (which is great to wear) feels a bit fragile. I'm presuming that this is a trade-off that Oakley makes to ensure that the frames are light and stay in place, and I'm overall very happy with their design choices - they never slide off the face or come loose by the ears, and the temples are very comfortable.These might cost a bit more than an average good quality pair of glasses, but they are worth it - they look great, are really comfortable and have high quality lenses.\", 2500: \"When it comes to fit and finish, it's hard to beat Oakley.  Fully met my expectations.  Though a bit spendy, they're not really much more than the other high end sports sun glasses.\", 2501: \"Just bought these XLJ'S and LOVE them. They're great shades. I bought some fire red lenses that popped right in and they look awesome.\", 2502: 'We all know what happened, but I must say it looks great and very functional. I ride motocycles and this help with the wind and sun', 2503: 'Awesome. Given to husband who uses it a lot outdoor. Would like to buy it for myself in the future.', 2504: 'My granddaughter wanted this style with the mainly black frame which is the most expensive. Very sturdy. The lenses are transition which was the only choice. They do not get very dark. Since darker lenses are needed for softball I then had to order replacement lenses. That was a disappointment because the glasses are so expensive with transition lenses.', 2505: \"I have purchased many pairs of sunglasses over the years and these are by far the best pair I have owned. They are light, well constructed and have great lenses. I can wear them all day without them becoming heavy on my nose or pressing against the side of  my head. I use these sunglasses for when I'm driving my personal truck or when I'm out riding my bicycle. I would recommend these sunglasses to my friends and would definitely purchase them again.\", 2506: \"These are seriously the best sunglasses you can buy.  The lens extends to the lower corner, so when you're backing up, or looking over your shoulder and the sun is right there, its not big deal.  They're comfortable and they stay on your head. They're also great for cycling, boating, and any other fast-paced outdoor activity, they keep the wind out of your eyes.  Plus, they look cool, I receive compliments on these every time I'm out and about.\", 2507: 'This product took what I thought was an extremely long time to receive.

So now he has his new pair and a back up pair that are a bit worn after years of use.', 2509: \"Was looking at these exact same sunglasses at the manufacturer's outlet store, but was having trouble justifying the price.

I have a medical eye issue and the doc said wear sunglasses as much as possible.  Well, I do a fair amount of biking, swimming etc. and had never found a pair of glasses that were comfortable and clear and didn't  slide down my face when I sweat. These take care of all of that and the clarity is not to be believed!  Light, clear, and so comfortable I hardly know I have them on.  19 miles on the bike today in 80 degree weather and virtually no movement even with some heavy perspiring. I have never believed in paying a lot for sunglasses but in this case, you do get what you pay for. Love em.\", 2513: \"I bought these sunglasses because I wanted a good pair of running sunglasses that would stay firmly on my face, prevent fogging, and protect my eyes. These fit the bill. The ergonomics are excellent--they stay firmly on my head whether I am wearing them over my eyes or on top of my head. They fit very close to your eyes, which is a plus for me. They lens quality is fantastic as well-- no fogging, excellent clarity, and they clean up really easily. I also love that you can replace the lenses. I have not found that the lenses scratch easily. If you want complete vision coverage, (the standard lenses may not cover the very bottom peripheral area of your vision, which is the case with most sunglasses), then get the XLJ lenses, but I liked the way the standard lenses looked and I don't need wrap around coverage. I dropped them on the tile of my kitchen once and there was a tiny scratch that is almost impossible to notice, but that is going to happen when you drop lenses on granite from 5 feet up.After a while with the black iridium lenses (which are GREAT bright condition lenses), I purchased the VR28 lenses for running on cloudier days, and I really like being able to easily switch lenses to adapt to my conditions. Also, the Oakley hard case is very handy if you travel with your sunglasses like I do. The only thing that I don't like about running in them is that sometimes the sweat under the frames causes my face to itch-- though I suppose that isn't Oakley's fault :-).If you have any last doubts, go watch the videos on Oakley's website about their lens quality. Supreme eye protection. I have had mine for just over a year and unless I lose them, I don't think I will need another pair of sunglasses anytime soon.\", 2514: \"Oakley Men's Flak Jacket Iridium SunglassesI have been a Rayban Lover since but when I first bought an OAKLEY TIGHTROPE, I'm loving it.

The only problem was the picture showed the frame as white with black but the ones I received was white with grey. I was told they did have the right ones in but the link I was given to reorder those was the same link I ordered from first so I decided to keep the first ones.', 2516: 'When I first wore these sunglasses I was thrown into a mild panic when I saw that the Oakley Icon on the right side of the frame was missing. I searched frantically until I found it lying inside the sun-glass case. It has an adhesive on the underside of the icon, I\\'m wondering why it came off or maybe it was never attached properly. Anyway another niggle is the polarized lens. When using the sunglasses the top half view of the lens has a very slightly whiter hue compared to the lower half of the lens. I wonder if this is due to the Polarization method used by Oakley. I have a polarized Ray-Ban and polarized Serengeti that do not exhibit any variances in lens hue. I also have an older non-polarized Oakley Half Jacket that does not exhibit any variance in lens hue. Being a premium brand I expect more from Oakley.Otherwise the \"look\" of these sunglasses are great and they really fit well on my face!

These sunglasses are sturdier and the lenses are much more resistant to scratches and abuse than my fake Oakley's.  You can't fake quality.

The fishing XLJs were the style and color I wanted and were polarized as well, a must.  I was concerned that the fishing XLJ blue lenses might not be dark enough to handle bright sun - not so!!  They handle the bright sun fine and the lenses don't fatigue ones eyes in dimmer light settings or driving - good all around wear.  Great fit with two sizes of nose clips provided and rubber material that actually does become tackier when one sweats.  Lenses can be removed to change them out with any flak jacket lense and case provides extra spaces for multiple lenses.  Thought Oakleys were just a fashion thing but these XLJs are truly top quality sunglasses with many great features.

Also, you need to be able to see the bottom if the water is clear to know where to place your anchor.  These glasses eliminate the glare and let you see the bottom better.  Even in our inland lake where the water clarity is very poor, I could see a bluegill hanging out about two feet below the surface along the dock with the glasses on, but I could see it all with the glasses off.Be sure to get a floating eyewear retainer as these glasses do not float.FYI: Others have commented that the sunglasses delivered from an Amazon partner were allegedly fake.  My order was fulfilled by Amazon, delivered in two days with Amazon Prime, and the sunglasses were authentic Oakley's.\", 2525: \"My eyes have seen the glory and it comes in an Oakley XLJ flak jacket package.

Being on the streams and rivers in various seasons gives me a unique perspective in quantifying data for a review and putting these glasses thru the paces I say go for it.

The left lense (left when looking through, not looking at) had the \"polarized\" etching, as does every other pair of oakley polarized lenses.  They were not the XLJ lenses, they were the normal size.  The box that they came in did not say \"polarized\" but these lenses are interchangeable, so that is probably the reason for that.  I can\\'t understand why people are having such problems with ordering this item.  My only complaint (and the reason that I did not give a five star rating) is that the lenses are too short for me.  I don\\'t feel that there is enough coverage.  I will be purchasing a pair of XLJ lenses, and the ones that came with them will be used as backup.A couple of days ago, I went to Sunglass Hut with my Half Jackets and compared them to the ones that they have there.

They eliminate the sun's glare off of the snow and water.  The frames are lightweight, comfortable and durable.

I went for a run with these today, and they were amazing.I\\'m not sure about the other posters saying that these are fake...I bought directly from Amazon, and they are definitely real.

Workmanship is very beautiful, very light !Price and transportation awesome!This is my first Oakley sunglasses .', 2563: \"I ordered my Oakley Straight Jackets off of the US Standard Issue website in Aug '12 mainly due to the price difference from other retailers and the availability of the flat black option through the Standard Issue site.There are plenty of reviews that talk about how great these glasses are, so I'll just cover the things I'm critical of:- Fitting:  Despite what any site says, you need to try them on somewhere first before commiting to a $150+ pair of shades.  I tried on the SJs (along with several other Oakley styles) at a local Sunglass Hut, and noticed that they were a little too small for my face, specifically, the lower portion of the lens frame, head forward, eyes down; I found this very distracting, but loved the style so much, I ordered them anyway hoping that I'd eventually get used to it.  I didn't, but they cost too much to just not wear.- Ear socks:  The right ear sock has started to split on both ends, with the portion closest to the end just a flap of designer rubber.  I find myself constantly fiddling with it.  For whatever reason, Straight Jacket-specific replacement ear socks are not easy to find on either of the Oakley websites.- Lenses: Although the lenses are still very clear in most lighting conditions, scratches and smudges are noticable, despite the &#34;ballistic&#34; protection claims and the dirt/sweat/smudge resistant coating.  I realize that Oakley sells lens cleaner/micro-fiber wipes for their sunglasses, I don't have those on me at all times, and revert to using the softest material I can find, which may end up being a slightly sweaty t-shirt on a 7-mile run.  Polarized replacement lenses are $40, so I've opted to just live with the scratches.  Also, body heat perspiration can cause fogging around the bridge of the nose since these frames sit so close to the face.  Sweat spots are unavoidable during strenuous activity.  Please note that although the polarized lenses provide exceptional clarity in high-level sunlight, they can make reading glossy-surfaced didgital devices (smart phones, MP3 players, tablets, etc) difficult to read.These are still my daily-wear sunglasses for commuting, jogging, beach/pool recreation, and double as safety glasses for yard work due to the high-impact material.\", 2564: \"I love the fit and look.  It's probably the best fitting pair of shades I ever had.  The only downside was the lens, black iridium polarized, is a little dark for me.  But I'm just planning on replacing them with something else.\", 2565: \"Love these Straight Jackets! Ok, so I just love Oakley's in general and have owned numerous pairs over the years. I tend to hold on to them for about 2 years before moving on to a newer pair. A bit more then a year into the ownership of the Straight Jackets (Black w/Iridium Polarized Lens) and couln't be happier. VERY comfortable at least for me anyways and as always top notch from Oakley! Their customer service is excellent as well.\", 2566: \"$100+ is a lot for a pair of sunglasses, but it was well worth the investment.  I would most often use cheap $10 pairs of sunglasses that would break after a couple months and broke my most recent pair.  I decided to take the chance in the investment and was glad I went with Oakley.The sunglasses (Polished Black/Black Iridium) are sturdy, comfortable, and work very nicely.  They are a comfortable mix of shade without being too tinted.  There's a little rubber on the inside that sits well on my head.  I have forgotten that I am wearing them at times while driving.

I started out years ago with the M frame, Pro M frame then moved to the Gas Cans probable 5 years ago before adding the Straight Jackets.

They're not cheap by any means and if you lose or scratch sunglasses easily I wouldn't recommend them but for me I can't complain, they fit my head like a glove and block plenty of sun, I didn't notice much of a difference between the polarized lenses and the regulars...well not enough to make me spend the extra money anyhow.\", 2572: \"I love my Oakley straight jacket and have been buying this style of Oakley for around 15 years now if not more.

If your looking for a great case to match the Oakley Large Soft Vault 07-025 is a perfect fit!', 2582: \"This review is for the Smoke Gray frame with Black Iridium lenses.This is my second pair of Oakely SJs. The frames are sturdy, hug the head firmly but not too tightly, and stay in place through even vigorous activity. They have proved themselves to be quite durable. Though it is subjective, I think they are attractive and appropriate with all but professional attire.These particular frames (Smoke Gray) are pretty cool: transparent gray off the head, but look virtually black when worn. Weird. The lenses (Black Iridium) are a standard dark gray. They are nice for a sunny or extremely sunny day. They don't seem too dark to me, but others think they are too dark. The tint is pretty neutral, almost a little on the cold side in that they flatten out contrast a bit and make colors seem a bit muted. Like other Oakley lenses I have tried, these are very resistant to flare (bright flashes/glare when at certain angles to the sun), very resistant to showing unwanted reflections on the lens' inner surfaces, etc. In other words, good optical quality.I've not tried the polarized version of these lenses, but imagine that if glare bothers you (esp if you spend a lot of time on or near water and other highly reflective surfaces), they may be the better option - though Revo and Maui Jim offer polarized lenses that are nearly as good as Oakley's and at competitive prices. I would have bought the polarized version, but these were so much less money and glare is not a big problem for me.\", 2583: 'Round eye frames are hard to buy off the shelf so I had to go online and found these.

Believe it or not, I've had a couple pair but by accident though. These are the first pair I have ever bought personally and have yet to find any fault with them.Fit perfectly and they're nice and dark.\", 2589: \"Bought these for my husband and he just loves them.  In fact, he babies them because of how much we spent on them.  His face shape makes it hard to find sunglasses that really look good on him so these were a huge score!

I\\'m going to return them to the store and get the non-polarized lenses put in. The frames are very comfortable but the lenses give a weird look to everything. You can not read a simple radio lcd screen while wearing these...It gives it a rainbow effect and looks blurred out. I\\'ve tried different lenses in the past and POLARIZED lenses always do it that. I thought that the Oakley\\'s wouldn\\'t be the same way, but they are. After all, everyone said to get polarize lens \"they are the best\", but not for me, I guess. Also, when looking at blacktop, it looks like oil sitting on top of water effect? :(  I really really hate to return them, but they are not worth the eye strain. In the end, I guess I should\\'ve known better, but I thought give them a try...I did and won\\'t do it again.', 2595: \"I bought a pair of these in April, 2011 with Fire Iridium lenses and they are the finest sunglasses I've ever owned. I need a strong prescription and Oakley was able to make them in HDO for me. They were expensive but when my prescription changes I can always buy new lenses. The High Definition Optics are much better than any other glasses.Being a motorcycle rider for the past 40 years I was unable to find a good pair of wraparound prescription sunglasses until I came across these Oakleys. Now I needn't worry about getting flying debris in my eyes when I ride and the appearance of these glasses turns heads because they are so pretty.A few months after I bought these glasses I purchased a pair of regular prescription eyeglasses from Oakley as I was sure about the quality of the frames and optics.\", 2596: \"I bought these glasses for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he isn't typically a sunglasses type guy. But he absolutely loves the Oakley Straight Jackets! They are sporty, fit snugly and comfortably to the head, and you look totally bad ass.

These:* exceed the ANSI Z87.1 optical clarity standards;* use the Oakley XYZ Optics to minimise visual distortion to the periphery;* resist smudging via Hydrophobic/Oleophobic lens coatings;* filter out 100% UVA/ UVB/ UVC and harmful blue light (up to 400nm) through Plutonite lenses.The black Iridium lenses (protection index 3 /10% light transmission) offer a true colour perception and dramatically reduce glare in bright sunlight conditions.The polished black O Matter frames are offset by the matt black Unobtanium rubber on the nose pieces, temples and ear stems.  The core function of the soft Unobtanium is to increase grip with perspiration and the tensioned ear stems hug the head.  The wrapped style of these sleek sunglasses is designed to meet the ANSI Z87.1 standards for both high-mass and high-velocity impacts.Uniformly cool, the Straight Jackets are a modern classic - equally comfortable in both casual and work environments.

Lost the first pair in a crash, and finally picked up a second pair which I put a yellow lens in and use them as safety glasses at work.

These things are good for literally ANYTHING, and the wide variety of replacement lenses means you can adapt it to any conditions. Yellow lenses for work, dark polarized lenses for summer driving... Lens swaps are quick and easy.

Since using them I have had no problems, however, I have found they take a little bit to get used too. The clarity is amazing and I think it appears that since everything is so clear that you feel like more sun is coming in through the lenses so I found myself squinting a little, but after a week or two all was good.

I was very happy to see that Amazon had them readily available, and at a fair price.', 2618: \"I purchased the 09-102 M Frame Strike after I saw it being worn by Matt Damon in Green Zone as I thought it looked really good and pretty cool at the same time. Upon receiving it, I was surprised at how light it was. Its also very durable, and I believe the frame can last a long time. The Strike lens is just right for my face, probably because I have a fairly large face. Some might say the lens is huge, but I think its perfect for me. Overall fit is very comfortable and despite me being Asian, it actually fits me well. Its just as comfortable as my Asian Fit Radar which uses the Path lens. And through time, if I get bored of the lens, its very easy to simply remove and install a different set of lens! I use this M Frame mainly for cycling, and maybe on certain occasions, for casual outings as well. The only downside of the M Frame is that unlike the Radar, the lens doesn't have hydrophobic, so they stain easily. But its easily cleaned by using the supplied micro fiber bag. With that said, Oakley should start using hydrophobic for the M Frame's as well, why they haven't done so, is beyond me. The M Frame has had a long legacy and is still worn today by the military (as shown in the Green Zone movie) even though the more superior Radar has been around for quite some time now. And if it can withstand the effects of war, I'm pretty sure it can withstand my cycling routes!\", 2619: \"This is my second pair of m-frames.

If that is a sell breaker for you, check out the m-frame strike 2, alot of my buddies here wear them they fit flush to your head,like flak jackets. and have the same lense.

They\\'re lighter than my old Ray-Bans and they also seem to sit better on my nose. Adds up to a much more comfortable experience, especially when I wear them for extended periods, such as on all-day drives.Highly recommended and worth the price.', 2626: 'I like these.

I've wanted Oakleys since I was a teenager, because they were the cool expensive kind.  Well, I am not disappointed.  These fit great and are really light.  I have long eyelashes that always hit my sunglasses, and these don't at all.  They feel well made, but the major difference is the lenses.  Oakley calls it HD Optics and they aren't kidding.  Everything is very clear and things seems separated out in front of you.  I wasn't sure whether it was worth $50 extra for polarized lenses, but if you're going to spend over $100 on sunglasses, I wouldn't skimp on that.  They're amazing.  I'll be sticking with Oakleys from now on.\", 2628: \"This was my first pair of sunglasses with polarized lenses, and maybe I just like that feature, but they blew me away.  I don't wear glasses or contacts, so having clear vision is especially important to me, and these glasses don't distort at all, like some others I tried.

We are both currently in the Middle East and 137 degree weather is right around the corner.  The receiver told me he instantly loved them. However, he felt that they were a \"little\" too small for his face.  He has a big head and wide face. He also did not think that they were dark enough. His eyes were visible through the sunglasses. So if you want dark or mirrored sunglasses, these will not be for you.I looked out of these sunglasses and the view was crisp/clean. The frame was equally stunning. The quality is great! No doubt these are Oakley.In the end, he decided to keep them.  He did not feel that the issues were big enough to return them, especially after he looked through them.  I personally think he made the right decision. These are an awesome pair of sunglasses and worth every penny.Note: The pic is misleading.

You should buy any Oakley sunglasses from Amazon, becasue you get the same service and you pay $100 less.  The Oakley company web site is a big rip-off for people who do not know the story.  There are web sites that offer &#34;Oakley-like&#34; sunglasses, probably made in China, that sell for $20.  I don't know the quality of these products, maybe one of you can fill me in on this.

I have tried on every pair of sports sunglasses Oakley makes and these are by far the perfect pair. The problem I had with other pairs from them is that to much sunlight came in from the bottom part of the glasses. The Radar Ranges where the key to the problem. I have them in black frame with black iridium non polarized lenses. I use them for everything even get them dirty an they clean up nice an easy, just please make sure you use the microfiber bag to clean them off with.

I want to get replacement glasses that is light, cover wide angle of my vision and does not fog up. I bought the Radar range which was designed for Golf and surprised that it works very well for Mountain Biking. It is very light, very bright for the iradium lenses and importantly it does not fog. I normally have to keep my glasses in the back pocket when I climb uphill but now, I just leave it on. It is much bigger than the half jacket but it came with the hard case. How often do you get case for glasses which is less than $100? Oakley is selling same glasses at $180 and this is a great deal with the case and extra nose piece.

Whether you're looking for a fashionable upgrade from your M Frames or you need sports sunglasses for high-impact activities, the award-winning Radar Range is an ideal choice. The impact-resistant Plutonite lenses have the largest vertical coverage of all the Range lenses and go deeper into the peripheral corner coverage than the Radar Path and Radar Pitch. In case you didn't guess, Oakley's Radar lenses are fully interchangeable, so you can switch tints and shapes to suit your needs. Oakley treated their lenses with a permanent hydrophobic lens that repels skin oil, rain and sweat to optimize optical performance.

I keep mine in the sunglasses compartment in my truck when I'm not wearing them to help protect them.These have rubber inserts on the nose and ear pieces to help hold them.

They are perfect: They don't slip on his nose, he can see well although the lens protect well from the sun and the polarized feature is very nice.He wears them also when he does not play sports for a casual look.\", 2685: 'I have been shopping for a good pair of sunglasses for years while breaking/losing a $20 pair every few months. I finally resolved to buy a high quality set, and decided on the polarized Oakley Straight Jacket. They are my best pair ever! Very durable and comfortable; I could not have asked for more.', 2686: \"The sunglasses showed up promptly and as promised.  I love polarized sunglasses and these oakley's were just what I was looking for.  Could not beat the price either.\", 2687: 'Bought these as a gift for my son and he loves them!  They fit very comfortably and stay in place very nicely for an active person.', 2688: \"I spent a lot of time looking for a new pair of sun glasses.  I tried on all types, and these looked the best on my by far.  I can run with them and they won't slip down and the lens is big enough that hardly any light gets through.  Excellent pair of Oakleys\", 2689: 'The first thing I did when I got these sunglasses was to check to make sure they \"truely\" were polorized.  You do this by putting them against a pair that you know for sure are (in my case some expensive ones I had purchased from my eye doctor) then you turn them 90 degrees.  If they are polarized they will get really dark and you can\\'t see through the \"two\" pair.  These were polarized.', 2690: 'I bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it! The lens was still clear even though he gets sweaty he said which is good.', 2691: \"Oakley is a great brand, specially because its made in the U.S., for people like me always working on the street, this sunglasses really protect your eye, doesn't leave marks on your face. I would recommend it for cops and military who is out in the sun a lot.\", 2692: 'Got the Oakley Straight Jacket in the mail, it took its sweet time but eventually got here. I have worn it many conditions, its a comfortable fit. Its super light and that sort makes the frame feel a bit weak but seems to be sturdy all the same. The polarizing is pretty good too.', 2693: \"Ok, this is the second pair of these glasses I owned.  I bought the first pair for more than $200 about four to five years ago.  My specific need was for a pair of sunglasses that would fit under my full-face motorcycle helmet and didn't make me look like Parris Hilton with more than half a square foot of lens covering each eye.  The Oakley glasses fit under Arai helmet perfectly, and they were tight so they didn't bounce around on my face at speed.Well, several years of use later and a few drops off the Kawasaki's seat onto gravel - lens first - the old Straight Jacket's lenses were pretty well done.  The frames were still perfect so I considered getting new lenses, but one day I took them off my head and examined them.  I was astonished to see ' Made in USA' cast into the one arm of the frame.  I don't know if that means everything is made in USA or if just the frames are made in USA, but to me it doesn't matter.I placed my order on Amazon not knowing if they were going to still be made in the US, but they are.  And they fit as well as the old pair.  The lenses are much, much clearer than the old ones, but the old ones were pretty well destroyed.  They fit my head tight with no vibration of need to reposition them after anything - they just grab my head and don't let go.  There is no discomfort, but I haven't worn the much tighter frame for more than 1.5 hours, the longest of my commutes.All in all, excellent glasses.\", 2694: 'The Oakley polarized iridium sunglasses are great sunglasses without a doubt. They are very comfortable, lightweight, and extremely durable. Not to mention no one can see your eyes through these sunglasses which makes it look so much better than others. I highly recommend for anyone who goes outside in the sun!', 2695: \"Great glasses.  In fact we were recently driving in a rain storm where in the past I would have had to pull over, but with these glasses on I could actually see.  It is rare for me to find a pair of glasses that look good on me.  This pair looks good on me.  I have received multiple compliments about the glasses.  The only issue I have with them is that the word polarized is etched in the bottom left of the left lens. My wife and daughter say they don't notice it when they put the glasses on, but I do.\", 2696: 'These glasses fit really well except for the pieces that go over your ears, they are too long so if you wear a hat they get pushed up and take some adjusting with your hat and glasses to fit just right.  Other than that they are great and I love them.', 2697: 'I really enjoy wearing these sunglasses. They eliminate all of the glare from the sun. I have a small face, but the sunglasses fit perfect and look good.', 2698: 'Those were a gift for my husband. He loves them. They look great on him. Gives him a cool look. Best price was at Amazon. I will try to get him a sunglasses case as those only come with a bag.', 2699: 'I really do enjoy my oakley jawbones. They fit good and are stylish. One of my favorite oakleys. I use them everyday for baseball. Perfect for sports.', 2700: \"I'm using these glasses from past 1 year and they are really good. Very light in weight. Material won't heatup in Sun and very comfortable. I love them.\", 2701: \"I'm very satisfied with the product! Great comfort and now I see everything clearer in sunny days. For sure I recommend.\", 2702: 'This will be my 2nd pair of the straight jacket and I absolutely love these sunglasses! I also like that you get a quality product with the price tag. Seems like I can break any other pair of sunglasses with ease, but these hold up to the torture I put them threw.', 2703: \"I bought a pair of straight jackets in black/iridium with polarized lens recently, since I lost my pair of oakleys some time ago and have been going without for some time. Since summer is coming up, I just decided to bite the bullet and headed down to the 'Hut and bought these.My title is referring to the classic look of a woman's signature black dress.  If you get these in black, they just will never go out of style.  The look is signature oakley, sporty, but not over the top.  For me, the full framed look really pops on my face, I have a rather skinny long face.  My old pair of Oakleys just had ordinary earpieces with no flair circa 2004.  These have a bit more flair to them, around the hinge with the Oakley logo and wider, straight ear pieces.  The fit is excellent, these aren't going anywhere unless you are wakeboarding and eat it hard.  I have Jawbones for cycling, I wanted something sporty, but not as over the top as those for casual wear and these fit the bill.I got the polarized (which are about 50% more expensive than non) but really, it's just better for your eyes to go ahead and make the investment and/or if you are going to be using it around the water or snow it is actually a necessity.  You can probably find a better deal online than at a retail shop, so I suggest doing so if you aren't pressed for time.\", 2704: \"I purchased the polarized/iridium flavor of the straight-jackets about a year ago to replace an old, worn-out pair of half-jackets that I dearly loved.  These glasses blew the doors off of the half-jackets.  Better protection, better fit, more universal style (dress up, bike/hike or hit the beach) and GREAT filtering of sunlight.  I lost them in the Atlantic Ocean while dragging my 2-year old out of the surf and immediately pulled up the iphone to order an exact replacement...these are worth EVERY penny of the now $390 I've spent on them...even had the shipping expedited to get 'em here fast!Wholly recommended by an avid outdoorsman, beach goer, driving enthusiast and golfer.  Spend the $$, your eyes will thank you...\", 2705: 'I tend to lose my glasses one per year. Good for Oakley, Bad for me. So I ended up looking at a few sun glasses and I like the look of the side with the waved flair, yet I still get rimmed glass wich works better for me b/c I have a full face (not this) and need thicker glasses. They fit great and have an expensive feel to them. I love them', 2706: \"These are great glasses. Exactly what I expected. I've been wearing oakley sunglasses for 20 years and was a little scared of ordering them online but they were just right and I saved $60.\", 2707: \"Yeah, these are pretty much the best sun glasses I have ever owned/tried on.  Yeah, I looked at the Oakley Juliet glasses, and they aren't as good as these are in my opinion.  For $100, I got sun glasses that looked great, work great, fit under my helmet perfect(not too tight or anything), and have a cool color scheme.  AND you can buy different color lenses for them too!!  They don't pinch  the side of your head, you can wear them forever and they wont bother you, and they don't come off easy when you sweat or shake your head around.  Fantastic for active people!\", 2708: 'very light and comfortable frames. excellent protection from the sun and glares. the transition lenses allow me to keep them on for a few a hours after sunset!i run and bike in very crowded places, in all seasons and at different times of the day... and these shades are just perfect!!lost the first pair, so got a second!', 2709: 'Fit well. The G40 transitions lenses are just right for bicycling in sun or clouds. And the Amazon price is really good -- bought a pair to replace one my dog chewed up (for the record, the dog loves the glasses too).', 2710: 'i got these as a replacement for some Bolles that had a lens pop out, i am very impressed with them.the only issue with the transition lenses is that if you are using them for driving remember that they are uv activated and will not work if the windshield is uv protected as well.', 2711: 'These are excellent for low-sunlight cycling (early morning / late afternoon) and the Transition lenses are excellent. Typical solid Oakley quality and comfort. Not as good in brighter sunlight as regular lens glasses, but still good. Definitely good value for the cost for an active cyclist.', 2712: \"I purchased these glasses to wear while running and cycling. I am very happy with their performance. The Transitions lens work well. I've worn these glasses in very bright light and at dusk. I'm a big fan of the style of the Flak Jacket. They fit my face perfectly. I plan on wearing these glasses in the Chicago Marathon this year.\", 2713: 'The amber color seems to have a poor transition darkness.  Nice for riding and sunset and sunrise.  Even at night to protect from insects  However during daytime it does not darkness as it says  It is recommended to purchase replacement lenses for different application.', 2714: \"I had hard time with protection glasses because i don't use glasses at all but work requirements made me use for safety, the product fit well and is light, confortable, clear and look good, I am using the glasses now in other activities. The gray color is...ok, and is not the best on dark days as I expected for Transitions but is..ok.\", 2715: 'I bought a pair for my husband last year.  He loved them. Great fit, great lenses.  He is in the car quite a bit and these are great for driving around.  They came with both soft and hard covers, which was nice (the ones I bought for myself only came with a soft drawstring case).  Although he has other sunglasses, these were his number one &#34;go to&#34; pair.Then someone stole them out of his car.  This recent purchase was to replace the originals.  Still the same quality and wonderful lenses.  Expensive to replace, but the first pair were so great, I knew what I would be getting.', 2716: \"As a biker, I get up earlyer than the sun and these Oakley's allowed me to use just one sunglasses from the time I start my training to the end of it, with the sun already melting my helmet. Great bugs and stones shield and amazing sense of improved site perception.\", 2717: 'I bought these for my husband. He works in construction and likes how the transition lens adjust with sunlight. These are great for someone who is in and out of buildings all day.', 2718: 'Really enjoy these for dawn and dusk rides.  They get let enough that I\\'m able to keep them on as \"bug shields\" much longer than my standard Oakley\\'s.', 2719: \"The biggest surprise is that they don't just darken everything when it is bright (which they do really well); they also make things just a tad brighter when the light is low! These are perfect for my purpose, running marathons in the 4-5 hour range. We often start before the sun is completely up and finish when it is very bright. I wear contacts so now I have &#34;sunglasses&#34; that I can wear the whole race to keep dirt and insects out of my eyes! They are very, very comfortable too. Light enough for long wear, but still feel solid.Do note that they come with a hard case even though the description doesn't say that. I ordered one and had to return it for a refund.\", 2720: \"I like the color/design of these a lot.  They are perfect for me, good for driving, but when go outside they get darker.  Kinda rose color at the lightest, wish it was a little darker, but not bad.  At the darkest it feels like a nice brown.  They are pretty comfortable, but the paint after just one month is rubbing off around the nose and between the eyes.  Fortunately so far it's just on the inside.\", 2721: \"These are the best looking Oakleys I've owned, and I've had more than 10 pairs. I love the Zero S and have bought second pair after I lost the first. They feel very light on your face and ears, and they are sized and styled perfectly. The crystal black is a bit darker in person than it looks in the picture.\", 2722: 'PRODUCT IS AS ADVERTISED. THE VARIOUS IMAGES SHOWN WERE VERY HELPFUL IN MAKING THE SELECTION', 2723: \"i bought this because of good price in amazon and good reviews. When it arrived, I find it too hug fitting to my head and a little heavy on my nose. I was disappointed of nit trying it first before buying. So i did 't use it.Recently, my eyes were hurt on a non polarized non oakley sunglass that I used, so I was forced to use this again -since I bough it with a black iridium polarized lense. At first it is really uncomfortable fit. But I kept on using it for days just to protect my eyes. Now, it fits amazing. It looks like the hinge had adjusted to my face size. I now use it everyday and careful not to scratch the lense. Like the design and fit. Not too big and good coverage since I bought the blAck frame. doesn't fog up and don't sweat on my eyes which I like since I'm here in asia.\", 2724: \"The Antix sent came with the oakley box and everything.First off, the brown frame is nice.  It is translucent when you don't wear it but turns dark brown when you wear it over your face.And it is light weight compared with the metal oakleys.The polarized iridium lens is not like the photo provided.  You can't see through it so your eyes are well hidden when you wear it outdoors.  When you wear the lens, there is a yellowish tint to everything which is fine.  What's most important is that everything looks clearer when you wear this, especially if you're driving in bright sunlight.To sum it up, cool looking, fits well, light weight, I love it!\", 2725: 'Bought it for my hubby for his birthday.Fits his chiseled n oval-shaped face very well. It is made of plastic, but does not look cheap. It can be worn not just for athletic wear. Gorgeous n strongly recommended. The pair is polarized n hopefully it will last.', 2726: 'I grew up a smith optics guy and I still am in a big way but these shades are awesome!  lightweight, stylish, love em.', 2727: 'I have the black polarized version of these. They kick ass! The black ones I look like man in black but heck the protection they offer are paramount esp the glare is totally removed from vision. Superb glasses! They also looked great on my rounder face/head :P Enough about the black ones, the tungsten version is next level up. I call them my fashion glasses since they go so well with all my clothes and brown hair with all the super duper protection of the black versions.Highly recommend it!!!', 2728: 'These sunglasses are very light and fit very well the shape of the face, though a bit big and look better on women.', 2729: \"I've always had problems getting oakley sunglasses due to the size. They are all too narrow. Now comes the Antix which fits my wider face to the T! The design is sleek and not too futuristic. It's just right and works well on a suit or with track gear. At $90.00, you can't go wrong!Great optics but can't fully handle high intensity sunlight, when it gets to hot. But it's still manageable. I'd still use it on the beach based on form and function.Overall, I would like to see more wider stance Oakleys with full lens construction. It's the only wway to go for me.Schumy\", 2730: 'These are real deal Oakley Antix.  They came in perfect condition.  Well packaged and super fast delivery.  These are my second pair of antix.

This Antix are polarized and works great into sunny days and cloudy days as well. The protection factor is 3 out of 4 (4 is not recommended for driving); therefore, if you are looking for the best UVA / UVB / UVC  protection Oakley polarized is the best option on the market.Specifically, Antix are a little big for small faces and fits wonderfully on medium to large faces. Great desing and perfect color combinations.', 2733: 'This product is exactly what I was looking for. My best pair of shades I have ever bought.Thinking of purchasing another pair in a different color. I highly recommend this product, especially if you have a slightly larger face.', 2734: 'Excelents lenses. The sunglases with polarized lens are useful when you come to the Beach. The UV rays and other are filtered for this sunglases. Aditioonaly the desing is amazing.', 2735: 'As described. The  fit is good for a medium to large head. Only comes with a soft case so you may want to order a hard case to protect them.', 2736: 'The only thing is they feel a little heavy on my ears.  Still getting used to them.  Great vision.

Light weight and very resistant material. Love it.', 2740: \"These are the best shades I've ever owned! I tried on shades at stores for several months prior. Due to my thin face shape many shades were too bulky for my face or just didn't sit right. I tried on the antix and knew I had to have them. I searched for them on Amazon and found them to be way better priced so I bought them. I've gotten several compliments off them already. And I'm super satisfied that I have a great pair of shades without breaking the bank.\", 2741: 'I liked so much. Excellent glasses. Recomended. Polarized is working excellent. This is one of the best models. Price was good to me', 2742: \"Not Cheap but worth every penny. They are so comfortable you can wear them all day and never even notice. The polarized lens cuts out the glare without really dimming the light so you get great clarity. They also hug your face so no light gets in from the side. Made in the USA is a big plus as well. Once you own a pair cheap sunglasses won't cut it anymore.\", 2743: 'A fantastic sunglass purchasing experience. These Oakley Antix sunglasses arrived before the expected delivery date. They fit great. So comfortable. The polarized lenses are worth spending the extra money on. No regrets. Very happy.', 2744: 'Great Glasses, I ordered these to replace an old pair of Oakley Gascans. These were a good choice as the frame size is similar and, they have a much wider field of view than the Gascans. I would recommend the Antix to anyone looking to upgrade the Gascans.', 2745: \"My husband has been wearing these for three years and he loves them. He has some vision problems and they are great for reducing glare for him. Also, his hat size is 8+ and most sunglasses are too tight. These fit him perfectly. I bought him a new pair for Christmas because the other pair has lots of scratches and scuff marks. That's not to say they aren't good quality, but he wears them EVERY day and he can be hard on them.\", 2746: \"Stays on my head no matter what sports or activities I'm taking part in. Excellent eye protection for fishing, especially! Polarized, comfortable.\", 2747: \"The glasses are great. I was surprised at how long it took to get the them here though.

I have always had a atnix Oakley sunglasses. This is my driving pair due to they scratch easy. I have two other pairs that I use for play and work.

Put on a pair of these and drive safe!!!!\", 2750: 'My husband saw these glasses at the sunglass hut in the mall..they were priced 180. I went online and got them for 140 and he loves them! yay me, best wife ever.', 2751: 'These glasses are plain slick....same shape as the \"hijinx\", but with the mono lens look.  The polarized lenses work great and I hope to get my money\\'s worth of mileage out of this pair.They are a good fit for a larger face and provide good wrap-around vision and style.', 2752: \"These were incredible (eventually stolen), just waiting to get another pair someday. Comfortable, good wrap-around protection, polarized for good measure. Best I've ever owned.\", 2753: \"I have a giant head. My hat size is like 15 feet and normal sunglasses look goofy on me. I always look like I've stolen my sunglasses from a little kid since they're so small on me.Not so with these bad boys! Not only are the lenses great (Polarized is the way to go) but I look like I have real, adult sunglasses on. The single lens style is great, too, if somewhat of a pain to clean. My gorilla mitts tend to smudge right over the bridge of the nose while I'm wiping them down. Really, though, who cares?Great sunglasses. I'll definitely be buying these again when mine get lost.\", 2754: 'The best sunglasses by Oakley.I like the Matte black frame, not into the polished shiny frames. very light and stylish. the cheapest price I found online for the polarized ones.', 2755: 'The polarized lenses provide great protection while also remaining stylish, these are genuine Oakley sunglasses, not much more needs to be said. You can take these to any Oakley store for free cleaning and repairs if needed.', 2756: 'I had made the mistake of buying these glasses at a local Sunglass Hut.  But a little shopping on Amazon saved me a ton of money!  The polarized glasses really cut down the glare.  My wife thought the one piece lens looked better than other Oakley models with dual lenses.The glasses came quickly and in the same exact packaging that the retail store provided.  I highly recommend this seller and, if you are in the market for Oakleys, these glasses.', 2757: \"I was concerned that the Antix would look a little big on my face. I would say I have a medium/small head. I really like the way they fit and I'm glad I went with the bigger pair compared to the gascans. The one piece lens is pretty cool look. I got the matte black with grey polarized lens. I really like the grey polarized lens. Everything looks crisp and clear with these on. They aren't too dark either. I bought them to wear while mountain biking and you can see easily on an overcast day even in the woods. I would recommend these sunglasses.\", 2758: \"I bought the Antix directly from Oakley. I got the Black Iridium lens. The view is terrific with very good color and no distortion at all. These glasses also fit snugly across and around your face. Because of the fit, they press up against your eyebrows and my eyelashes rub the inside of the lens. As a result, it takes a bit to get use to. Personally, I don't mind since I like the snug wrap around and total coverage, but others may not feel the same. I highly recommend trying on these glasses before purchasing. Also, because of the tight fit, you will experience some fogging in the area where the lens crosses the top of your nose. The amount of fogging varies with the temperature and humidity etc. Some may find this annoying. While the fog area is out of my field of vision, I notice the area needing more repeated cleaning.I have yet to find the perfect pair of sunglasses, but overall these are not bad. I was disappointed that they did not include a nice case but a cheap little cloth bag. For the price I paid, I would have expected more.\", 2759: 'Has he trucker, these polarized lens really help filter out the glare when driving directly into harsh sunlight.A A+', 2760: 'Love these sunglasses.  They are AWESOME.  Huge fan of Oakley!', 2761: 'I love these.  I have a medium size face and they fit great.  Love how the lenses make all the colors look even better.

Not too flashy, looks great with light and medium skin tone.\", 2764: \"I think these glasses are great! They fit a small size face well! I do not agree with the guy that said they don't fit small to medium size faces\", 2765: 'This is my second pair of polarized 5 squares.

Very light and strong', 2767: \"The Oakley Men's Fives Squared Polarized Sunglasses are the best fitting shape of sunglasses I have ever owned.

I have had them before, with a narrow face it is hard to find anything other than kids glasses to fit. These do perfectly.', 2769: 'The polarized are great for cutting down on glare. It really saves your eyes from being strained and tired. It is worth the little bit of extra money.', 2770: 'I have owned many different pairs of sunglasses in my life. These by far are the most comfortable. These are also my first pair of Oakleys. They fit perfect. I will never own another pair of non-polarized sunglasses again. The polarization is worth the extra cost and the clarity is perfect. Comfortable and lightweight.', 2771: \"I tried to save money and go for a cheaper pair of sunglasses, and I should have just bought these to begin with.  I spent about $50 on the others, and they were flimsy and they didn't fit well.  These, they fit great and they're comfortable.  I usually keep a pair for years, so that justifies the high cost to me.  Highly recommended.\", 2772: 'The price was great and the quality is what I expected--a real steal for polarized lenses. Amazon speed of delivery was quick as usual.

And can't beat the price!\", 2776: \"These are my second pair of five's... They fit great! And everyone of my friends that tries them on like them too.. Won't be the last pair I buy! Received from seller as described and on time..\", 2777: \"Got my pair of Oakley Five's Squared in the mail on time and undamaged. The color was as expected and for a narrower profile these really fit well and didn't move around (good for active wearers).

I would buy this product again.', 2779: 'My 3rd pair from oakley - and I love the style and size. I have a small face, and these are perfect. I love everything about the glasses, but wish they had a nose grip . They slide pretty easy when you sweat. I tried using them for slow pitch softball , but they slipped a lot. For driving, watching sports, hanging out, etc, they are great casual glasses.', 2780: 'Polarized is the way to go. The lenses are crystal clear. I would recommend buying the hard case for these. I have the Oakley flak as well and these are more professional looking and i use them at work all the time.', 2781: 'Ordered these after trying different styles of Oakley sunglasses out at a retail store and found the Fives Squared to be the best fitting for me. Wanted a pair of sunglasses to use while driving to and from surf sessions during the day (usually wear prescription glasses but also use contact lenses - mainly for surfing). So these are not worn during \"action sports\" type activities or as a style accessory. Felt like trying a brand with a good reputation and still made in the USA - qualities Oakley sunglasses have. And if I didn\\'t like them, at least I wouldn\\'t be out big dollars if I had bought them at full retail price.The verdict? I must have been crazy for having waited so long to buy a pair of decent sunglasses - the reduction in glare and the clarity these offer is a great relief for my eyes because using removable (soft) roof racks prevents the use of the car\\'s visors. Plus being out on the water under the blazing Hawaiian sun for hours, one\\'s eyes could use a break from all the glare. I\\'m so pleased with these, wouldn\\'t mind getting a pair with polarized lenses since they are supposed to be even better. So 5 stars and no regrets.', 2782: \"I wear a 7 3/8 hat size, and have a broad face, so hard to find Oakleys that don't look like BCGs to fit me.

After reading reviews I took this into consideration and am very glad I did. Reviews do help.', 2792: \"I had just lost my Oakley's five square frames that I had had prescription lenses put in. They were the only sunglasses that I had actually had several compliments on how they looked on me . &#34;)  Funny enough, a friend found my glasses in her purse by mistake after being at my house after I had ordered these on line. ( for a cheaper price than I had originally paid ) They came so quickly and at such a good price that I am keeping them just in case.  Very satisfied customer here!!!!\", 2793: \"These sunglasses are exactly what I needed. They are not polarized but are still plenty dark. I use them when driving and am completely satisfied.

I wasn't sure about the grey lens, but it is perfect for any season.\", 2797: \"These are my first pair of Oakleys. I like the relatively simple look of these sunglasses. Some pairs of Oakleys are too bulky in my opinion which I'm not a fan of. These are pretty much perfect though.\", 2798: 'This is my second pair of Oakley fives. Just love it. Not too big but not that small either. Ones the job', 2799: \"This is my 9th pair of Oakley sunglasses and as with all Oakleys the lenses are fanatastic. They are a consistant color and block the UV rays very well. The frames cover my eyes completely as I use them for riding my motorcycle quite often. They are extremley light in weight as well. My only complaint is that they fit a little loose on my head. There are no rubbers on the arms and therefore they are a little loose but all in all a very good pair of Oakley's.\", 2800: \"These are the perfect Oakley's for everyday use in my opinion. They are not too big and they are not too small. The lenses cover all of my eyes and the sides are also well shaded so no light can come in. I always use these when I'm outside mowing lawns or operating with the fire department as they are properly safety rated. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who needs protection from the sun, while doing something that requires eye protection for safety.\", 2801: \"I have a smaller frame and face but have always liked the style/quality of Oakley.  After reading several reviews, I decided to give these a try, and I love them.  They really do fit those with smaller faces quite nicely.  They don't look too big/out of proportion with the rest of your face.  Also, the optics are great - very clear.\", 2802: 'These are overall great sunglasses and are my second pair of Oakleys. I wear them almost everyday and love them. I have a smaller framed face so these fit well, although I have found that the Oakley Batwolfs fit better. The price on these is great as well.

I think that 10% of the rental cars in the US have a pair of my sunglasses stuck on the visor.  The Oakley's were on sale but still not all that inexpensive.  None the less, I ordered them along with other cheaper and sportier sunglasses to be used while biking.The biking glasses arrived within 5 days.  The Oakley's, which were from a different non-Amazon source, were to have shipped on Feb. 4.  My credit card was debited on Feb. 4.  A week or so went by and I was very politely informed by the vendor that they were very sorry but their supplier had not delivered when promised and that the sunglasses would be delayed.  I could substitute a different pair of equal value, or wait.  Since it's rare that winter in CT requires sunglasses, I opted to wait.The sunglasses arrived on March 24th.  Finally.  I do not fault the vendor for the delay - I was warned - but do question that my credit card was punched so early.  This may be an Amazon thing as the origianl shipping notice said Feb 4 and Amazon assumed the product was shipped.The glasses are fine and on the one sunny day since receiving them, they worked as advertised.  But I am a bit mystified about credit card being billed some six weeks before actual product shipment.\", 2807: \"These are great pair of shades! But they don't fit my face! :(Dealer did not say that where for small to medium face.But hay lenses are crazy clear!\", 2808: 'After having them for few years, lost my previous pair to a huge wave at the beach.When I got home, ordered a new one.', 2809: 'Exactly what I was looking for and cheaper then they were in the store.

I have a small face that causes most sunglasses to look like alien goggles but these are great.', 2812: \"These are by far the nicest sunglasses I've ever owned, I didn't think I'd like them when i tried on the Oakley oil rigs, which were too tight on my head. I tried  these on and they were perfect, awesome brand.\", 2813: 'Frame is not too big but not too small.  I have an average sized head.  The glasses give good eye coverage while still looking classy (as opposed to sporty).', 2814: \"I ordered these after I got to Afghanistan a month or so ago.  I left my my more expensive Oakley's at home for fear of losing them, breaking them, somebody steeling them, etc.  I brought a pair of cheap ones I picked up for $20 at the store before I left.  I regretted that decision as soon as I hit the sand box.  I forgot just how much brighter it is out here (it's been a couple of years since my last trip).  After doing a little research, I decided the 5's Squared made the most since.  Light, great Oakley lenses, and sturdy frames.  I was actually surprised just how light-weight these are.  They feel sturdy in the hinges and don't have any weird movement in the frame.  I don't have an oddly shaped Quasimoto head or anything and these fit just right.  They also sit closer to your eye socket to really keep the unwanted glare out of your eyes.  Definately worth the $75 and the 3 week wait to get them out here in the middle east.  So, if you are looking for a pair of entry-level Oakley's that fit well, protect your eyes, and look pretty cool too, you really can't go wrong with these.\", 2815: 'these are exactly what my husband has been looking for, and much less of a price than we have seen in the stores, even outlet stores want double this price. the shipping was fast and they are exactly what he wanted.', 2816: 'Tried on these shades in a department store, then found them on Amazon for a fraction of the price.  They were shipped quickly and brand new (as described).  My only beef is that the lenses are a little too light for my taste, as I had used the Oakley black iridium lenses previously.  The good news is that you can order lenses separately in a black iridium polarized and other shades as well.  Still a great deal in that if I do order the extra lenses, it will be about the same price as if I purchased just the glasses in the dept. store.', 2817: 'My head is huge but not round like a basketball, so these fit me perfectly. I had LASIK done a few months ago and bought these knowing they would supposedly have a bit of a tight fit because I wanted to block out any light or debris that might creep in on me and was not disappointed in what I received.It kind of sucks that the only current seller is asking $200 for these since I paid well under half of that through Amazon, especially since the smoke frame and warm gray lenses are a really good looking combination in person.', 2818: \"These glasses have great fit! They are polarized and provide excellent protection from the sun's glaring rays. I also feel like I look super cool in them! Lots of compliments too. I definitely recommend these shades.\", 2819: \"I replace my Oakleys about every 2 years and this pair is up on 2 years.  Mine are the polarized shiny lens model.

It was time to upgrade my current pair of glasses so I took to Amazon to look for a pair and came across these (I got the black frame/grey lens) and couldn't pass on a pair of Oakley's for $48. I haven't owned a pair of Oakley's in years, but always enjoyed the style and fit. I have had these for a few days now and I really like them. They fit like a glove on the face, are very stylish, and very light. They cover the eyes perfectly--not too big or too small to cover them up without letting much sunlight in. They have a perfect shade to them which blocks the sunlight out really nice. The only reason I took 1 star off was because due to how light they are and the material, I am concerned that they can easily be broken by someone sitting on them on accident. However, I would highly recommend these.\", 2833: \"This sunglass is all I need, for  a good price. It's stylish, it protect from the sun and is light in weight.

She likes Oakleys and she had a pair like this that she lost.  When I received it through the mail, I inspected it to make sure there were no scratches on the lens or any manufacturing defects.  There were not any.  The material did feel kind of light, and the plastic seemed lower quality than my other Oakley.  My other pair did cost twice as much.  Gave it to my wife on Christmas and she loves it.  She said they are the most comfortable sunglasses for her.

Keep in mind, they are designed to fit a smaller face. They aren't tiny by any means, but they will be snug if you've got a George Lopez dome. The lenses are fantastic and provide excellent protection from sunlight. They're not quite as good as polarized lenses but they're more than sufficient for everyday wear. If you're looking for extreme sun protection then go polarized. The build is a bit more cheap feeling than most Oakleys, but they aren't flimsy by any means. The fit is great, the sytling is typical Oakley and they're an overall nice, well priced (even at full retail) paid of shades.\", 2853: 'Once again Oakley has put out another superior product.

I'm 5'4 and often find glasses that are too big looking on my face.  These are perfect.\", 2863: \"Solid, durable, decent looking specs.  I'm not one to spend 300 smackers on sunglasses.  I would inevitably run them over with my bike, then accidentally pee on them during the first week of ownership.  These guys are terrific.  I run a lot and ride my bike with these and they're really nice for an active lifestyle.  I'm glad Oakley didn't try to sell me gas station quality glasses with their brand name on them.  Somewhat rare these days when companies have as much pride as Oakley clearly has in their cheapest product offering.\", 2864: \"I got these to replace my much loved Canteens. It's tough if you have a narrow head to find glasses that don't stick out a lot at the temples. These don't. The only downside is that they're almost too light. That's a good thing when you're wearing them, but if you push them up on your head when you go inside they have a tendency to fall back down. That's a super minor gripe though, these are excellent sunglasses. They also come in a polarized version if your on the water a lot.\", 2865: 'I had a pair of these before, and a pair of gascans.

Which is to say it doesn't go over the top anywhere, but it's completely, 100% adequate.  Lenses are good, though they let through a little too much glare than I expected with the Iridium coating, but they're still pretty good.  You can't look close to the sun on a bright day, but most of the time they're just fine, and they're also light enough that you can wear them in twilight or inside without it being too dark......not that I wear them inside, that's for the people powdering their noses.\", 2881: 'these are some great sunglasses.

They are a great fit, great for doing sports and for a casual were as well.', 2890: \"I really wanted to like these. They do look nice and feel relatively comfortable, but I ended up deciding to look for slightly bigger glasses because I ended up liking how these look off me better than how they look on me. They are also lighter than a feather and completely plastic. So although they look nice for light plastic, dropping this much money on cheap-feeling plastic gave me a little bit of buyer's remorse. I was fortunately able to return them without issue though. Four stars for being good, but not great.\", 2891: 'I got these sunglasses about a week ago and i LOVE them. They are my first pair of nice sunglasses and for the price they are the best you can get. Love them!!', 2892: 'These sunglasses are excellent, especially for someone with a more narrow face.  They are very comfortable and quality is good.  Very happy with the price paid as well.', 2893: 'This Review is for the Fives squared \"Ducati\" glasses with polarized lenses.I must say I love these glasses and feel that they rank among the best frames I\\'ve used, even better than some of the other metal framed Oakley\\'s too. Now before you get your pitchforks and torches! Please hear me out as to WHY I like them, THEN feel free to burn me.Firstly, they\\'re comfortable... I have a big head (not my fault, I blame genetics!) and the shape and construction of the frame accommodates my face so well that at times I forget that I\\'m wearing them. They don\\'t fit loosely, they fit snug, and this is because the frames expands slightly while gently applying tension to sides of my head effectively hugging it, plus they\\'re very, very light. Considering that I enjoy mountain biking in winding singletrack trails often and the fact that these frames hold on and feel comfortable is pretty slick. They\\'ve yet to fly off my face. I think if your head is medium to large then these frames will suit you just fine. Realistically though, your results may vary.Secondly, they look great. The Ducati model in particular features a Ducati red \"O\" on the side along with a nice matte black paint coating the frame. Another added touch is the mirrored smoked \"plutonite\" lenses along with a \"ducati\" laser etching on the lower part of the left lens. With the exception mirror coating the added touches are strictly aesthetic...but still pretty sick.Thirdly but most importantly, the lens quality... Oakley in my opinion has always delivered the best in the lens quality department consistently. Once you\\'ve worn Oakley\\'s (in case you haven\\'t) other glasses tend to seem muddy in lens comparison whether it may of be $10 \"gas station\" quality, or in my experience, the $200 designer (I\\'m looking at you Bolle!). I simply love these lenses, and if you can, go for the polarized. The equiped lenses are on the darker tint so I find them very effective on sunny bright days, and the clarity and contrast is amazing! Aw Heck, it may just be the Oakley Kool-Aid talking, but I do feel you do get what you pay for as far as the lens quality goes.Lastly I can vouch for the durability. For example, just the other day I carelessly left the frames close to the edge on my night stand, which in turn led to them falling on the floor, which in turn led to me inadvertently stepping on them. I didn\\'t apply my whole weight, but just enough to hear an audible \"pop\". After much expletives I was relieved to find out that only the leg popped out and that was easily reattached (I wished that would\\'ve been the case with my Spy\\'s when I stepped on them too...). So yeah they\\'re tough, but I certainly don\\'t think these glasses are indestructible and I feel I got off easy that time so caution is encouraged, they\\'re glasses after all.In short despite the price I\\'m very happy with my purchase, and while looks may be subjective these do look hella dope.', 2894: \"These are the exact fit that I was looking for and they have everything else other lenses do that's why I give it 5 stars. First, I purchsed the Gascan's because I loved the style and they fit pretty decently, but after wearing them for an hour or so I realized they just didn't fit perfect and when you pay this much for sunglasses you want them to fit perfectly right? so I checked these guys out and they were an exact match to my face. I have a small bridge and somewhat oval face. These glasses are somewhat small but they are great if you don't have a huge face.\", 2895: 'Ran these over with my car last summer backing out of the fishing hole, lenses popped out, sides popped of the hinges.... Popped them all back in place after cussing myself out for twenty min and was good to go... Couldnt elieve it!', 2896: 'It came in great condition. Had nothing broken on it and was a great price. Made a great gift too! Would recommend to anyone', 2897: 'My husband wears these sunglasses all the time, they are his favorite. They are very durable, and has lasted him many years.', 2898: 'I have a small face, and these are great, only glasses that I can say I like the way they fit.', 2899: \"I was afraid to take something that couldn't fit my face up; when I say this is because my face is small. However I just tried this wonderful sunglasses in a store close to my work; since then I knew I found my sunglasses. I took the right choice and I love it. Just make sure to chose the right case to protect it. It feels really good and they look solid. This Ducati polarized version is awesome! I also bought the large vault case with the red icon from the Oakley store and also love it. The most amazing thing is that it just cost me $95.\", 2900: 'outstanding sun glasses ,comfortable,good style,good  quality,durable,fit my face,recommend to buy it .plus ,its made in USA.enjoy the sun glass.', 2901: \"Great set of sunglasses with a sleek look.  I like the matte black color and prefer it to the shiny sunglasses.  They wrap nicely around your eyes and protect them from the sun at all angles.  I have a skinny face so I was looking for a pair that does not stick out too wide on my face - these are perfect for me.  They are also lightweight and fit comfortably on my nose.  The lens are sensitive to scratches so be careful - i accidentally dropped mine on the floor and got small scratches on them when they were 2 months old.  I recommend these so don't hesitate to purchase.\", 2902: \"This was my first venture into a pair of Oakley's that did not have a metal frame. I opted for the Ducati edition because it was the only way to get a flat black finish on the frames in the Five Square style. I had averaged a pair of new Oakley's every two years. I have now had these pair for over two years and they still look great. I run, bike, and use them every sunny day. I rinse them under the tap when they are covered in sweat, and I throw them into my cars console when not in use. I clean them with whatever towel, shirt, or rag I can find. So, they take abuse and still look great. There are maybe two small scratches, but I can barely see them. The only sad part is that you cannot get replacement lenses with Ducati embossed where the Polarized usually is. Not that I am a fan of Ducati. It is just unique. Great Glasses!\", 2903: 'I love this product completely.It fits in nicely and looks stylish as well. It is definitely worth the money spent.', 2904: 'I wanted a light pair of sunglasses that would stay putwhile driving my Ferrari with the top down. The black iridiumlens was a plus. Great glasses, & quick service from Amazonthank you, ciao TR', 2905: \"I've had these sunglasses now for about a year and they have been one of the best pairs of Oakleys I have  owned. I really do like the polarized lenses, this is my first pair with polarization  They also fit my face very well and they're very comfortable, I can wear them all day without any fatigue. I've owned approximately 10 different pairs of Oakley's over the years and their quality is always been  high and always comfortable to wear, these, are no exception. Did I really need the limited Ducati sunglasses probably not but the red O is cool\", 2906: 'THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST AWSOME PURCHASES I MADE ON AMAZON. I WAS GIVEN SUPERB CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM....... IT WAS AS USUAL AWSOME. GREAT GOING AMAZON.', 2907: 'The  sunglasses are very lightweight and comfortable.  I ordered them online and was concerned that they would look effeminate on me after reading one of the reviews from a woman who brought a pair for her boyfriend.  She said they are \"women\\'s sunglasses; not men\\'s.\"  I found out to the contrary that I look masculine with them on when I looked in the mirror.  They fit snug, but it\\'s okay.  I would recommend them to anyone.', 2908: \"Having a small face makes it so difficult to find a pair of sunglasses that don't look huge on me. If I could imagine the perfect pair of sunglasses that look stylish and fit well, it would be these. They are comfortable, yet snug on my face. I am very happy with this purchase.\", 2909: \"These are hands down my favorite pair of Oakley's that I own.  So much so that I bought another pair when I lost the first ones.  I personally like the matte black finish over the polished black and the polarized lens are a must have.\", 2910: 'I really like these sunglasses.They are snug to my face and fit well around my ears. They are especially great for really bright environments including the golf course, beach, and while driving into the sun.', 2911: 'Great for the money!Smaller fram for a smaller head. Looks good, and lots of colors to pick from. Thanks', 2912: 'My husband loved the sunglasses they are just like the picture and the price is great for what youre getting. No case included', 2913: 'Great glasses! they fit perfect and look great! they came in sooner than I expected, which was awesome! I have wore them nearly everyday since they came in!', 2914: 'Missing microfiber cloth, that was supposed to be included.  This was a gift and they were really happy with it.', 2915: \"love this style of glasses, Oakley 5's are dependable and inexpensive Oakley. Although next time I would buy the Burgundy looking ones for two reasons. 1) they make everything look really cool. 2) It is the best color to protect your eyes from all those UV's\", 2916: 'The perfect birthday gift, they are sturdy and very cool....kid really love them for his birthday. polarized for excellent vision also', 2917: \"I have had these glasses for 2 years so i decide to review and before i did so i looked at the other reviews. All these people are mad that they feel cheap and they are not Oakley quality. They do feel cheap because they are completely plastic and youre spending 100 dollars on them, most oakleys go for around $150+. Even though they feel kinda cheap they are still very durable, have amazing clarity and are very comfortable. They will not work for sports for most of the time but they aren't meant to. If you want great looking durable glasses for driving, going to the city, walking in the park, etc these are perfect.Plus you will forget they are on your head because they are so comfortable and light.\", 2918: \"It's hard to find sunglasses that actually fit my head right, but these do. I've dropped them several times, too, and they never broke.\", 2919: \"these seemed to me like a women's color up until a few months ago.  i got these for my wife and i got me a pair of the flak jackets.  after a month or so we discovered that the flak jackets will stay up on my wife's asian face and non-existance nose bridge, so now these are mine.  funny, they dont look so much like women's glasses anymore.\", 2920: 'Los oakley supero las expectativas, muy buen producto, llego en perfecto estado tal cual lo ofrecieron en tienda, totalmente satisfecho.', 2921: 'Love these and have bought a second pair so that I have them in both cars.  They fit really well and are a quality product.', 2922: \"I can't review these for their intended purpose, since I bought them as replacements for a pair that belonged to my ex. So I have to judge from the wreckage left over from the battle of The Bulldog vs The Oakleys. The shards of gnawed plastic looked sturdy even though they weren't able to withstand the tremendous bite pressure created by my pup's vise-like jaws. The lens were still in one piece even after being forcibly removed from their housing and deposited several yards away. Quality? You bet. I give these sunglasses 5 stars for construction and for entertainment.\", 2923: 'Perfect size, perfect fit, the colors (black and orange) contrast nicely, and most importantly they block the suns uv rays effectively', 2924: 'I received the parcel earlier than I thought, not just that, I received it in a great perfect condition. Since that was my first time shopping online, I start having confidence and trust buying through Amazon!', 2925: \"I love sunglasses, and have a few dozen pairs of expensive brands.  I have a pretty average sized face and head, helmet size Medium, hat size 7 1/4.These fit on the small side, even for my small head that makes normal glasses look big.  The frames are a different material that is bendier, hence much MUCH more durable to things like getting hit in the face with stuff, sitting on them, trying to squeeze them into a helmet, or having your two year old check them out.  Oakley quality all the way.  I'm not sure what to say about the style, since they're a new design but they have that aggressive Oakley look that Oakley was all about like 10 years ago.  I like them either way.  You'll have to find a pair to try on though to see if you like their diminutive size; they're about the same size as Twenties (XX), also from Oakley.\", 2926: 'Love these 5 squared. So sleek and make you look so damn cool. Love the polished white frame and black lenses. The contrast of the lenses are standard oakley quality= pure beauty! Also I have a slightly smaller size head so I researched and found that these are made exactly for one with a smaller head. They fit great and are super lightweight. Almost wanna get another pair to have in black and get violet lenses because I love the styling & fit so much.', 2927: 'I use to like the design of Oakley because it is sporty.Im very satisfied with the glasses that i received.', 2928: 'Excellent shades, really pleased with the design and the quality. Case/cover looks cheap but the glasses fit nicely on your face and looks good. Working in Afghanistan you need strong glasses for the fierce sunlight.', 2929: \"I've tried on several pairs of white sunglasses and all three of Oakley's.  I think overall the look is a very personal preference but these are sleeker than the Fives Squared and smaller in size than the Fuel Cells.  The fit and finish is spot on.  The Oakley bag is white, which will probably get dirty quickly but a nice design touch.\", 2930: 'I was hoping for a good product for the price, and believe me, I was not disappointed with these glasses. These sunglasses fit perfectly on my face and the lenses themselves are amazing. HDO optics is probably one of the neatest thing these sunglasses have to offer.I would recommend it to all and worth the buy!', 2931: 'An all-around great pair of glasses. The frames feel solid, look sleek, and fit well. The black lenses have a smooth mirror finish. Putting them on is where the Oakley quality shines. Crystal clear vision that remains sharp in the brightest of light. The curve of the lenses means your eyes are protected all over and provide a practically unobstructed view. Your eyes will thank you. Your sense of fashion will get a boost as well. And for the price being offered by Real Cyclist these Jupiters are nearly a steal.', 2932: 'Oakley its a good choice always, the price is excelent and the new hd glasess the vision is very cleare in a sunny day. if you are looking for a good pare of shades with a retro look oakley is you choice', 2933: \"I absolutely love the look, quality, and performance of Oakley Jupiters.  Oakley always makes great glasses and the Jupiter is no exception.  They have a great retro yet modern look.  I have a med-large face and feel like these fit quite nicely. I've been wearing them for over a year and have had no problems.  I've worn them doing everything from rock climbing to mountain biking, to flying.  I am by no means easy on them (throw them around, never put them in a case) and they have never scratched or broken.  Only complaint (if you want to call it a complaint) is they don't offer enough colors!\", 2934: \"I wanted oakleys that weren't for sports (flak jacket, etc.) so these seemed to suit my purposes. When I got them, i began to wear them instantly. And, they are awesome. I've had them for about 2 monthes but man are they good sunglasses. ordered them in red too but black is probably the best. just ordered my 3rd pair yesterday (black and brown).\", 2935: \"You can't go wrong with Oakley. These shades are great. The retro look makes it great. I would suggest buying different colors custom lenses so that you have several sunnies in one.PS- Be sure to get the o-matter one...it feels more reliable than the acetate one. Notice that there is a small size difference between the o-matter and the LX models.\", 2936: 'I like styles that are timeless but interesting. I usually buy Coyote sunglasses, but Amazon had a great price on these Oakley Jupiter sunglasses. I need a bigger fit, and they fit well, and the light plastic is barely noticeable. However, the frames are larger than I expected, so that they give a real 80s retro look (with updates, such as the curve on the glasses). The glasses are right in that space of \"cool but unobtrusive\" and \"making a bit of a retro statement.\" The lenses themselves are great--no glare, no distortion, and a nice enhancement of depth when worn. The frames are a light but not cheap-feeling plastic; overall, these sunglasses feel well-made, and the integrated hinges give them a smooth, one-piece feel.', 2937: \"Awesome light weight Oakley's that feel great. I can not think of any negative feedback.\", 2938: \"These glasses are fantastic, lightweight, durable, and for a great price. i love that they don't black out the color around you but offer great shade and protection. plus the awesome amazon price. shipped quickly and received in great shape. totally reccommend these glasses and amazon.\", 2939: 'llegaron justo a tiempo...cual lo acordado....el precio insuperable...100% producto original, ningun contratiempo // precio vs calidad sin ningun problema ..', 2940: 'My uncle owns a pair of jupiters and right away I knew I needed to get these. I love the fit and the way they look. All around they are great sunglasses.', 2941: \"I bought these cuz I was looking for shades comparable to Ray Bans but NOT Ray Bans! way to many people have and there are fakes everywhere.... I'm an Oakley buff ever since I got my first pair of Twenties back in the day. When I saw these I fell in love. They fit really nice for a big guy like me. The white and gold is really stylish and look awesome in the sun. The mirror on the lens is really nice too.\", 2942: \"Very fast delivery. I have gotten tons of comments on the sun glasses. These glasses were discontinued and replaced by the 2nd gen, Jupiter Squared. I have bought 5 pairs of the LX's so far, in various colors, and get comments everywhere I go. I also own 4 pairs of 1st gen Frogskins which still turn heads.\", 2943: 'I bought these for my son but have even worn them myself a couple times when he left them in my car.

This is his 2nd pair (the 1st pair broke at the hinge and has scratches on the glasses, however, is still wearable).Yesses: The supplier was prompt in sending the sunglasses, packaging was good and kept the glasses safe. Price was also substantially lower than retail price in South Africa (including shipping and import duties). The sunglasses are fairly light in weight, lenses has a mirror effect without it being irritating to look at and the type lens is adequate for light sensitive eyes. Slight wrap around design and thick arms ensure that side light or glare is not an issue.No's: It took some searching to find these on Amazon as ranges are not uniformly  labelled or described. Point in case: Search for Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses and see how many different descriptions appear for the same product.\", 2951: 'Great', 2952: 'As expected.

Glasses look amazing, fit my head perfectly.  (I recommend these glasses over the 'gascan', I had authentic gascan Oakleys and they were tight on my noggin).  They are super light, the iridium lenses look super sleek and borderline mechanical, almost a 'terminator' or mech warrior quality.  I have the chinese/hong kong knock offs and although the knock offs look very good, there is a definite quality difference, only time will tell how they hold up vs the knock offs!\", 2954: 'my boyfriend loved them and it was just what he wanted. they are great glasses to block off the sun', 2955: \"I'm in South America enjoying the summer.

I got mine second hand from my cousin and I have worn them ever since Summer of 2011. The only real problem I have with these is that they aren't a very good pair for sports. I play baseball a lot and it seems that they fall off my face when in a rush to pick up the ball. It could be just because I have a small face but otherwise these sunglasses do a great job at what they're meant for and they are pretty good-looking.\", 2959: \"These sunglasses are awesome, I will never wear a pair of s***ty Walmart ones again, unless I'm at work, but the quality of the lenses is just outstanding. Great price too. Come in the original Oakley box. Thinking about buying the flat black ones\", 2960: 'It is amazing the looks I get from these glasses. I am complemented on them at least once a day.

In addition to this I also purchased separately an Oakley Carbon Vault Case (Large) which in one word is Awesome.

I'd consider myself to have an average sized face and they look great I like mine a little larger but Aviators look ridiculous on me so this size is about perfect. I will say that the first pair that I got had some what I think were factory defects on the lenses but Amazon and their ever awesome customer service shipped out another pair and they were flawless. I could not be happier with these sunglasses. I did a bit a show rooming at Scheel's to find the pair of Oakley's I wanted so if you worried about the fit just go there and make some hapless employee get all the glasses out of the case that you want to try on and then just make a mental note of the style you liked the most. The name of the style is usually on the inside of the ear piece.

For some reason it felt lighter than the one I tried at the shopping mall (which is actually a plus), but due to the frame's size and format it does fit perfectly on people with broad faces (big heads you can call it) as myself, I tried leaning on forward and it did not fall or even hanged, it stays nice and tight.\", 3022: 'I bought these cause they were different and looked sweet in my opinion.

I own sunglasses made by Rayban, Wiley-X, Sama, and Randolph Engineering, along with other Oakleys, but these are by far the best. They weigh nothing and are very comfortable. They've taken alot of abuse in my travels to Iraq, Egypt, England and other places, they never failed me, and I literally wear them every day. They are perfect for driving and flying.

The nose pieces were lost before long, as they don't stay seated well with rough use, but it didn't really matter because they are so light that I could barely notice the difference.Ordering my new pair now as my last pair is finally scratched.

They are of amazing quality. The lenses are amazing, they are very clear and provide superb sun protection. I was a little confused with the title when it said one size fits all because i was expecting to get the GASCAN S (small). It turned out to be just what i was expecting. They fit my medium sized face perfectly. The shipping was pretty fast, however the glasses were not well packed.  They didnt come in the original box, only in the pouch that comes with all Oakley glasses. I was a little dissapointed by this but there was no damage to the glasses what so ever. Overall Amazing quality, Very stylish, Perfect Fit, Superb Protection. Great buy for anyone!', 3030: 'Hello I just purchased this pair of sun glasses at Sun Glasses Hut, and I must say they look aggressive and badass.I have a fairly wide head and big brows (im 75% german). I also weigh 150 pounds and am 6\\'0\" tall. I got the Gascan Polished Black Iridium Polarized sunglasses, which supposedly run larger than most sunglasses Oakley makes. Sadly, these still pinch my nose and my head right above my ears. They fit snug don\\'t get me wrong, but honestly I wish there was some way to customize the size online so I could actually have a comfortable fit.This is also the first pair of sunglasses I\\'ve ever owned, so maybe I\\'m more upset about the fact that it\\'ll be hard to find sunglasses my size!The one weird thing about these, is when I\\'m looking at my 25\" Hannspree monitor, I can tilt my head slightly to the right and suddenly everything becomes very dim and dark. When I tilt my head to the left (both slightly and as far as I can go), the light in the monitor does not dim. I\\'m gonna be contacting Oakley to find out why exactly it does this - maybe it\\'s a defect in my sunglasses or monitor. I think it\\'s safe to say it\\'s probably my monitor, but I\\'m weirded out by it cause I\\'ll frequently tilt my head slightly and it\\'ll cause the image on the screen to brighten and darken. Anyways they\\'re meant to be used outdoors, but I just thought it was odd.Either way they look badass, colors look vibrant, things look sharper, and the polarized lenses make things with glare a bit more exciting to look at (as you move your head and keep your eyes straight, you\\'ll notice changing colors much like a rainbow - hard to explain but when you see it you\\'ll want it).  I also love the chrome accent on the Oakley logos.If you have a normal sized head these should work great (or the smalls), but if you have a wide face like mine it may be a better idea to try them on before you buy them at a store or order them online.', 3031: 'THE PERFECT SUNGLASSES !

Would buy again in a heartbeat!', 3033: 'Very nice looking pair of glasses, with a gourgeus fit. I don\\'t need to tell to everybody about the quality of the Oakley products, so I\\'m going to write something that happens to me that only confirms about the quality of these glasees.In January I was cycling in a peloton with something about 20 guys and the speed was up to 40kph (25mph), I was almost in the front of the group when a retarded start zig zanging in front of my wheel man, well this \"smart\" guy suddendly got out of the line and when my wheel was bridging the \"smart\" one decide to return to the line without looking!! So to avoid stopping and crashing the hole peloton, my wheel man, made some evasive movements and I couldn\\'t avoid when he touched my front wheel, and well the rest is history. When I was standing up I taked a look to the grow and there was my new jawbone resting on the ground wihtout his arms. I was very desapointed because I thought I had lost my new glasses so I collected the arms just thinking in save it for memories. Then I\\'ve found that the arms isn\\'t broken, it has just disambled, I assembled the arms again and the glasses was ready to go. One lens got some scraches but that\\'s ok, comparing to what could happen, the damage was minimum.Concluding, theses glass are very beatifull and very well designed!RegardsConrado', 3034: \"I actually customized my Jawbone sunglasses at the Oakley store, but 99% of the features are the same. My frame is all black matte, ice iridium polarized lenses, black iridium lenses, and I have VR28 black iridium polarized on the way. I use them for everything from just going out to lifting weights in the back yard to running in the Houston heat. You will love the hydrophobic lens coating. I used to use the half jackets for running and they'd fog up and the sweat would just stay on the lenses when I ran, but you will not have that problem with the Jawbone. The arms of the sunglasses are shorter than average sunglasses, but this works out great because they're just long enough to fit securely, but short enough to wear a hat, helmet, etc. comfortably. It's genius. They are perfect.\", 3035: \"I've owned these black gloss and red fire polarized jawbones for about 4 years. I use them while road cycling. The polarized lense is excellent quality, and I still cannot understand why anyone would not NEED polarized.  The lenses come out easily, to properly clean, or swap to a different lense.  The frames fit well, but, over time, have become slightly loose as they hold the lenses, and on my face. I'd prefer a screw to be able to tighten the temple.They are a bit beefy for the frame, and can cause slight obstruction when looking back for traffic, although it's not that big of a deal.Primarily, I like the lenses. They're not too dark as to cause problems while riding (especially fast descents) thru shade.  During the day, when not riding, I prefer dark, dark polarized lenses, like 8% or 9% light transmition. These are 15 or 18%Lastly, I'd actually prefer if they made a real polarized glass lens option for these. Glass are much easier to clean properly, and are far more scratch resistant. Over time, I feel that I am slowly rubbing the tint away.I've owned oakleys since 1987, and Fernando and Kimi will keep me loyal.\", 3036: \"They look sick, perform well, and I couldn't ask for a better deal. I've been wanting a pair of quality glasses for some time now and after looking through oakley's selection,this one was by far the best. you can get more lenses for it and they're a breeze to change. A very sturdy frame that can be used for any sport in the blistering Floida sun.\", 3037: 'I\\'ve owned quite a few oakley sunglasses all my life and I have to say this design ranks at the top of them all...Very easy to switch lenses, what more could you ask for.  Also, the vents on the lens (that it came with) really help with \"fogging\" issues...If you\\'re a fan of oakley sunglasses; this is a must to own.', 3038: 'I purchased the Oakley Jawbone Sunglasses online for my husband the week before Christmas (a last minute idea).  They arrived 2 days sooner than were scheduled to and my husband loves them. They are a quality Oakley product plus the cost was much lower than any other vendor online or in the stores.', 3039: \"Suffice to say these are the finest pair of sunglasses I've ever owned. I must warn you though, my opinion is a bit biased because thus far these are also the only sunglasses over $30 I've owned, so their superior quality shouldn't be a surprise. I've always thought it ludicrous to pay over $100 bucks for a pair of sunglasses, but after moving to Arizona I was convinced I should invest in a quality pair of shades to shield my eyes from the harsh desert sun.The frame is very durable, and the lenses can be replaced with little effort. They're also very comfortable, and after getting used to them I can walk around all day wearing them.My only complaint is that the additional yellow-colored lenses that came with the shades are all but useless to me, but that is about it.\", 3040: 'I am a life long Oakley sunglass wearer and I recently decided to upgrade my current pair of half jackets.  I was debating on flak jackets but after going to the store and trying on the Jawbones I was convinced.  Well worth the extra money.  I opted for the polarized Polished Black Frame/Red & Persimmon Lens.  I was a little nervous about the red polarized lens because my eyes are very light sensitive and given the 18% light transmission i thought it might not block enough light.  I usually wear the dark gray polarized lenses on my half jackets that only have 10% transmission.  The red lenses are great and block plenty of light so that on bright days i am not bothered by the sunlight and the newest Oakley lenses are spectacular with the clarity of the High Definition Optics.  The polarized are great at blocking unwanted glare as well.  They also come with the second lenses that I have not tried yet but look good for neutral situations.  The jawbones are unbelievably comfortable, even much better than the half and flak jackets.  They also have more complete coverage with larger lenses than the previously mentioned sunglasses.  I still wear my half jackets occasionally but the Jawbones are well worth the money and I could not be happier with my purchase.  To boot they also come with a very nice hard case to keep them well protected.', 3041: \"This is my first sunglasses splurge and I am so happy. They fit well, perform flawlessly, are durable, and look great. LOVE THEM. I run and bike in these and wear them on my boat. Running, they are not heavy or klunky at all like I thought they would be. Couldn't be happier.\", 3042: 'Have used these for 3 triathlons and many cycling and running training sessions.  Excellent coverage with no line of sight interference. No fogging even without the vented lenses.  No sweat streaks on lenses or pooling of sweat on frames. Changing lenses is very easy and second pair of lenses (yellow) is great for dusk running. Only concern is with switching out the nose piece.  Felt like I had to force it so I left it alone.  Frame fits just fine as is on my oval shaped face and averaged sized head.  Great pair of glasses.', 3043: \"Excellent optics and overall quality that you expect from the biggest name in sports optics.All in all, very good, they only note that I need to make here is that the Positive Red Iridum Polarized Lenses scrached so easily, It just amazed me.I was puzzled by the fact that it developed scratches out of the blue, I pride myself to be a very careful and meticulous guy, so I was very frustrated to see that the scratches kept appearing on the lenses... I purchased ventilated Black Iridium for riding, and those haven't developed a single scratch, so it's either due to being polarized or it's because they are defective...that away, awesome\", 3044: \"My old Bolle sunglasses have been my favorite for years.  However, some frame damage has caused the left lens to fall out daily.  I finally became too frustrated with them, and started my sunglass research.  I have always wanted titanium framed glasses, and I knew I wanted superior eye protection.  I figured, I REALLY don't want to lose an eye so why not get the best?  I am so glad I purchased these sunglasses.  They are stunning!  You can really tell that they are optically correct.  Compared to my beloved Bolle's, these things were crafted for something divine!  I will be sticking with Oakley for quite a while I think.\", 3045: \"the polairzed lenses provide fantastic contrast and clarity! don't know why all lenses are not polarized!very comfortable and durable frame.looks good too!\", 3046: 'This is my third pair of Oakleys and by far my favorite.. They are nice and light and the Polarized lens is top notch.Do yourself a favor and buy the Oakley case with them', 3047: \"The Splinters are more comfortable and because of the hinges, fit much more better. The larger lenses keep out the sun from the sides of my face and are much more clearer. Don't get me wrong, the Wires were great, but the Splinter is a larger step up in my opinion.\", 3048: \"I wouldn't be buying another pair now, had I foolishly not worn them into the water while at the beach, where I foolishly turned my back to a wave. I'll let you figure out how that one ended.When I owned them, they were great sunglasses. I tend to be hard on just about everything that I own, and these were no exception. They took just about everything I threw at them, including stashing them in a pocket in my cargo shorts on a number of cramped roller coaster rides, where they came through with mostly flying colors, only requiring a small adjustment to get them back to the proper shape to fit my face.I do recommend making sure you store them in the bag, as I did pick up a couple small scratches from my months of abuse. It wasn't anything major, but they were noticeable when wearing them.Mostly though, they did what they were expected to do, which is to both keep the sun out of my eyes and make me look good. I'll be buying another pair after suffering through with some $10 drug store sunglasses that I just can't bear anymore.\", 3049: 'I bought these pair of sunglasses last year (September, 2011) and I have to say that it is my favorite pair out of all the Oakley sunglasses I own. I wear these for driving and fishing and they work very well. Their very stylish and worth every penny. Go Oakley!!!', 3050: \"I am very particular about my sunglasses.  I have a hard time trying on sunglasses and finding a pair that looks good on my face.  Finally with the help of my fiance I went for these glasses.  I also needed the fact that they could be fitted with prescription lenses as well.  Lenscrafters is currently the only company that works with Oakley for Oakley lenses.  Because the lenses are curved alot places like Costco or Sam's Club cannot make lenses for it.  I forked out $310 for lenses though, so be aware of that.  I wear these every day I go outside living in sunny San Diego these are a must.  Cheers!\", 3051: 'I received these replacement lenses in an original Oakley packaging and was able to install them without any problem and it fits perfectly.', 3052: \"Sunglasses are personal by style and color but if your looking seriously at these... I can't say enough about how well they fit and perform. They put RayBan to shame. Iridium coating makes a serious difference in clarity and it reduces glare as well. You get what you pay for.\", 3053: \"I have owned the Oakley Whisker polarized sunglasses for nearly two years.  I still love them.  They live in Colorado, where there is 320 days of sunshine a year, so these glasses get a workout.  I have been skiing, sailing and fly fishing with them and never given them any negative thought.  I have been completely satisfied, with their comfort, durability and style.  I have not had any of the complaints voiced by other reviewers.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but the quality of my experience forced me to leave a review.\", 3054: 'I had these sunglasses for about two years before leaving them in my lap as I\\'m getting out of the car, dropping them on the pavement and then stepping on and crushing them.  They were my second pair of polarized Oakleys and my third pair of polarized sunglasses in general.  By far, these are my favorite sunglasses and I will be buying a replacement pair very soon.These glasses stay on your head very securely without being the least bit uncomfortable or \"clamping\" too tightly to your head.  Of all the sunglasses I have owned, these blocked light from all directions the best, especially from the bottom.  Normally, if you glance down the slightest bit through sunglasses, all the bright, unblocked light comes through and blinds you.  These glasses curve in such a way that they still fit closely around the side and bottom of the eye, blocking more light but again not at the sacrifice of comfort.I had no issues with any screws or loose lenses that the other reviewer complains about.  Plus, I\\'m sure I probably dropped these glasses from a moderate distance at least a few times and never had a scratch on the lenses.  My personal experience with Oakley, as well as that of my entire family who together have owned upwards of ten pairs of Oakleys, is that build quality is not an issue, though I cannot speak for customer service in the event that you get a lemon pair.I tried the brown ones out first, and while I liked the look of them aesthetically, I didn\\'t like the color distortion when looking through the lenses.  Black/black iridium for me.  I can\\'t wait to get another pair of these (and take better care of them this time).', 3055: 'These Oakley glasses are nice....I was looking for small and thin but I have to admit, after having the plastic wrap around glasses, these seem to let a lot of light in. Love the look but ya know......', 3056: 'I have never been more please with a pair of sunglasses in my life.  I have had all the major bands and like these the best.  They are extremely scratch resistant, mine have bounced lenses first of the concrete twice with no scratches.  I love them and will buy another pair at some point.', 3057: \"I have about a dozen pairs of Oakley sunglasses, but these are my favorite.  I love how light these sunglasses are, they look great, and I like polarized lenses.  You're not going to find them any less expensive anywhere either.\", 3058: \"Simple, this is really good. The lens that came with it is really good but I replaced the lens with a dark polorized one with another [...]50 dollar. I customized it myself so I have to give it a 5/5 because I made it a 5/5. But with this frame and the lens it came with, yea it's still really  good. Your'll look rich with it. Bad part, it doesn't hide your eyes that much as you think (sorry poker players). Still not a good reason to give it a below 5/5 mark.Oh and the lens don't scratch easy. Plus the case it came with is really hard which is really good because other brands come with soft cases and you can still break your sunglass when it's still inside. These, you don't. Worth the [...]200 bucks.\", 3059: 'Worth the price I got in for on Amazon.com. Light yet strong and comfortable to wear.', 3060: \"Until I lost them. The titanium frames were made for klutzes like me who drop things, and the lenses had the perfect curvature to fill in the gaps where most sunglasses do not. So far Oakleys have been the only pair of sunglasses I can wear that I do not notice virtually any distortion of my vision, and can still accurately shoot with them unlike most. Now, I'm off to find the best price I can on these again.\", 3061: \"I bought these because my other Oakleys sprouted legs and ran away when I was deployed(ensure you keep an eye on them all the time) I've owned these for over a year and can honestly say that if you ever try using other glasses you will really appreciate these...they are light, clear, consistent and light (yeah it's worth mentioning twice) I use them for trekking, climbing, hunting, fishing(AWESOME BTW), work, driving, bicycling... pretty much anything which would benefit wearing sunglasses/eye protection and love them... I love them and I'm thinking about getting another pair just in case since this model is now discontinued... Oakley was dumb getting rid of these!\", 3062: 'These new oaks are great. They more than exceed my expectations. I got them for a great price ( 220$).', 3063: \"I have owned these glasses for about 2 months now and I can confidently say that I am very satisfied with my purchase.  They are so light that you almost forget that they are on your head.  They are great at providing full coverage for my eyes and the polarization provides great clarity on those really bright days.The only downside is that they are a bit on the expensive side.  I cant testify to the durability; if past purchases of Oakley prove to be the bench mark you are in for a long ownership.  (Assuming you don't loose them!)On the plus side for Amazon these were about $150 cheaper on Amazon then they were at the retailer (in Singapore)....buy them while they still have stock!\", 3064: \"This review is for black frame/black iridium lensesThese are hands-down the best sunglasses I've ever worn. If you tend to wear sunglasses for extended periods, especially in harsh conditions, there's a good chance you understand the benefits of splurging on good eyewear. For me, function is more important than form though these glasses bring both together in a fantastic package. They are a certainly a little pricey but to me they are worth it.The Pros:1. The optical clarity is flawless through entire field of vision.2. The polarization cuts out almost all glare. I generally wear only polarized sunglasses but the technology used here is noticeably better than anything I've used previously.3. Incredibly light weight and comfortable. It's very easy to forget you have them on.4. Excellent coverage.5. Look great.The Cons:1. Lower price would be great but they are worth the premium price tag.I can't really rate durability yet but with the flexible titanium frame and lenses that meet ANSI standards, I'm hoping they last a very long time. Time will tell.The bottom line: I'm very satisfied with my purchase and believe they are worth every penny I paid as long as they hold up the way Oakleys generally do.\", 3065: \"I have two sets of these glasses. They are far the best quality lens I have ever used. Get em' while they are hot.\", 3066: 'When I got these, the looks definitely struck me.  They look like they mean business, yet not a bit flashy.  They are very clean and classy.  So if you\\'re looking for something to make you look like you\\'re there for a purpose, these are it.  But they won\\'t make you look as if you need attention.  I love that!When I first put them on I did notice how light they are.  I\\'ve had glasses that are as light, but not with a lens this size.  What I didn\\'t like was the fact that it didn\\'t sit on my face very well.  The nose bridge didn\\'t meet my nose very well, but given that I\\'m Asian, this is to be expected.  Luckily the nose bridge piece is removable and adjustable.  After trying out a few different adjustments, I got them to fit great.  I Also noticed that the bottom of the lens was rubbing on face a bit.  This was because the ear stems were obviously set for someone with a bigger face.  I actually detached them from the lens and adjust the screw-pin.  This also did the trick.  Once everything was perfect, I found them quite nice.  The optics are wonderfully clear. The lens size and shape make it so it pretty much covers my entire field of vision, making it seem as if I\\'m not wearing them.  The one complaint I would have is that because of the very flexible \"memory\" titanium ear-stem, the fit is somewhat soft so I doubt they would be as snug as, say, my Oakley \"Whiskers\", which feel like they\\'re glued on.  But these are definitely more comfortable to wear, an acceptable trade-off.  These are my 7th pair of Oakleys and I can say they are the best in most areas.  I probably wouldn\\'t be too active in them.  I\\'ll leave that to my \"Zero\" and \"Whisker\".  But they\\'ll be my favorite driving glasses and my favorite for a night on the town for sure.  But shelling out $300 for them will obviously make me very mindful of where I take them.  They ARE pretty expensive even for Oakleys.', 3067: 'Got these for my husband whom had to have them. This was the best value I found saving $100!!  He loves them and they fit and feel wonderful on his bald head!

I tested this and I'll swear on my mother, that these work to block out glare related to some situations like heavy rain.. I love these glasses, and I've had my pair for 2 years with no problems.. I think if the lenses are popping out and people get mad about that, they should stop sitting on them and realize that just because something works good, doesn't meant it's idiot proof and unbreakable to fools.

When I received the glasses I didn\\'t se \"POLARIZED\" on the lenses.  Thinking they my have changed the design for this idiation of Cosshair, I brought my glasses to the Oakley Store to confirm.  RESULT:  They most definitely are NOT Polarized, as advertised on Amazon.  The whole reason for spending extra $$ is to get Polarized lenses.  The polished chrome/polarized VR-28 lens isn\\'t even offered, unless I order the Plaintiffs.

It really feels great!I was reluctant to buy this from river of goods but when the package arrived, perfect!', 3081: \"The Oakley Crosshair 2.0's are excellent looking, well constructed and comfortable sunglasses that are a slightly squarish take on a classic aviator design.  They look and fit well on both small and large heads,  feel  incredibly sturdy,  and are priced fairly -- especially for an Oakley  metal frame.  These are a LOT better looking than the Crosshair 1.0's,  which were much too vertically narrow,  and too wide.  Oakley enlarged the eyepieces vertically,  providing better coverage,  especially if you have a large face.  The hammer stem earpieces look great,  and allow for better fits for wide heads (no straight spring hinged stems). The nose bridge is convex in appearance,  making the glasses feel super solid,  as well as  looking great.  If you're tired of classic aviator style frames,  but also don't like the more outrageous look of many other Oakleys,  you should give these a try.\", 3082: \"I've always wanted a pair of aviators but the hard plastic nose pieces of the typical aviator glass would cause them to slide down my nose with any perspiration.  The nose piece looks similar to the &#34;standard&#34; style but they are made of a soft silicone and stay put.They are very light weight and comfortable to wear.  The ear piece don't dig into my skull after a few hours like some of my other Oakelys.They don't come with a case, so factor that into your purchase plan if you don't already have something.  Oakley website lists which of their cases work with these. The Large Soft Vault worked for me.Enjoy.\", 3083: 'This is one of the best sunglasses I ever owned. I used to have Rayban Polarized and this is far better compared to that.', 3084: \"I like the color, the glasses are not shiny and all the details are pretty well manufactured. It's a really nice product, totally original, it comes in an official Oakley box with special plastic protection inside.

The orhers color are beatiful too', 3087: 'In contrast to the other gentleman\\'s review, I have had my pair of Crosshair\\'s for over six months now. No issues with them as of yet. I don\\'t see how the lenses could pop out of the frame because of tension.. I\\'m looking at mine now and they seem to be curved in precisely the same manner as the frame. Should not have any tension on them. I can\\'t comment on them being knocked out by any \"slight impacts\", I am very careful with my sunglasses.Oakley has discontinued this model though, so there very well could be an issue with them. My pair is a custom set, so possibly I lucked out. It sucks they d/c\\'ed them. I had been waiting years for a set of Oakley\\'s that resembled aviators. These are quite nice.

I would definitely recommend them.', 3089: 'I am very pleased with these sunglasses.  They are my second pair of wire frame oakleys ive owned, the first pair I bought in 2005 and still have.

I compared them to Ray Bans and I perfer Oakley casue I have a large head and the Ear Arms never reach behind my ears and irritate me. So the straight arms are great.

That was handled well by Oakley services as they send me new ones free of charge as they were aware of faulty product. What was not so good was that when putting them on since they were tight I bended end part of the glasses almost 90 degrees. I bended it backand it is ok but it should be done by Oakley. The new rubber fitters are still good after a year or so. Not so lenses. After about six months of playing volleyball on the beach they are so scratched that I cannot see through them.Lens also fell out and now the frame is little twisted so I do not want to get new lenses as I might need a new frame.', 3101: \"These glasses make me look awesome..My friends think they looked great and it's me and all that.

They're well weighted, but not too heavy.\", 3107: 'these are great aviator glasses...ive gotten many compliments from friends and strangers while wearing themthey fit my face great and stay on my head firmly.lenses are good not great, price could be a little bit cheaper seeing how these are an older model..', 3108: 'I bought for my wife, and fit just perfect, have tha old school style with a touch of modernity, love this purchase, was perfect', 3109: 'Great lenses and a durable frame.

They are the most comfortable pair of glasses I own and probably the classiest.', 3115: \"I ordered these because I have had a total of 4 pairs of Oakley Crosshairs in the past 10 years.  I loved them so why change.  I did not realize that Oakley messed with the naming conventions. The original was the crosshair, the next was crosshair 2.0, so one would think the 3rd version would be crosshair 3.0.  Nope, they went back to calling it the crosshair.  So, I was disappointed that I did not recieve what I thought I ordered but that was my own fault.I do really like the glasses but I am still disappointed they aren't MY glasses.\", 3116: 'Excellent', 3117: 'Lost a previous pair of nice sunglasses, so after breaking a couple pairs of cheapo gas-station ones, I decided to buy a nice pair again. Initially, I looked at Ray Ban becuase of their updated twist on a classic style, but actually found these Oakley Crosshairs to be overall better looking and more comfortable on my face.The lens and frame designs are great, with great proportions and weight balance throughout. The only thing I would change would be the flair-out section of the ear piece, but it is pretty easy to overlook unless it is pointed out to you. The black iridium lens color is great in the summer sun and the polarized lenses are awesome at reducing glare, while not messing with the viewing of electronics screens, which can be a problem with some cheaper lenses.I was also surprised at how light they were, since they do appear to be a bit bulky, but once they were on, I could barely notice them, which says alot considering my last pair of shades were super-light Silhouettes. I would definitely recommend these sunglasses.', 3118: 'I got very exited when I got them it was mor&eacute; than I expectorad especially for the price I pa&iacute;d for this sunglasses', 3119: 'They are light, the optical quality is flawless, they look great, people give me compliments on them, they wrap around a little so you get excellent peripheral vision.

These are slightly larger lenses than the 2.0, and I din\\'t realize just how much better the visibility would be through them. Very comfortable fit, very sporty \"aviator\" style frames, and great visibility. Plus the ease of ordering with Amazon, and they were delivered within days of ordering!

They always meet my high expectations and would recommend them to everyone.Thanks...', 3123: 'I bought them as a gift for my son and he liked them a lot. They are modern, light and stylish. I ordered the ones with polished black frame and warm gray lens, and the color is beautiful.', 3124: 'This sunglass is the best I have every bought. The design is cool and the frame is able to fit firmly.  The item is also well built and more importantly, it is affordable.  Highly recommended!', 3125: 'Here we go again totally biased review because Oakley are the only sunglasses for me!That being said these frames have been totally to my liking. I have a moderate to bigger face & they fit snug & sit well. No slipping or comfort issues. The protection is polarized so you get exceptional coverage. Not to mention the fashion statement they make, totally winner once again!', 3126: 'I love everything about my crosshair. I just have a little issue with the fit. It slides a little.

He was happy with the glasses and so was I.', 3130: 'This design gives a distinctive look to the classic aviator style. Feels sturdy in the hand and contours well on the face. The quality-to-cost ratio is exceptional. The lens are good enough for most purposes, although I would definitely recommend the polarized option for driving if the additional $50 is not an issue. My only wish to Oakley is to add a polished gold trim version.', 3131: 'I have enjoyed my glasees very much and would recommend them to any looking for a good pair of glasses.', 3132: \"Love these sunglasses!  I was a little disappointed in the pictures.  These Lead Frame appeared to be more chrome in the description pictures but were actually a mild gray color.  I was hoping for the shinier chrome style.  That and I did not like the polarization, as a police officer the polarization caused computer screens in the car, my phone, and other displays to be distorted.I have since returned these for the chrome frame (non polarized lenses) and couldn't be happier.  I ordered the Black Iridium replacement lenses to replace the VR28 Black Iridium lenses (these look yellowish/brownish) and I wanted just a dark lense.Overall very happy with Oakley, as always.\", 3133: 'These glasses fit perfectly and are amazing in every aspect. The polarized effect is good, it especially helps me while I am driving with sun glare.', 3134: 'Pros:Good quality, feels strong and durable. I like wearing it in the sun.Cons:At this price it should include a hard case.', 3135: \"Owning multiple pairs of Oakley's and Ray Ban's over the years, I have to say these sunglasses are one of the better pairs I have owned.  They are light weight, have good coverage (which is important to me, I find it annoying when sunlight gets in through the sides) and have a good price point for polarized lenses (I purchased them when there were bout $132.)  The polarized lenses are probably the best part.  It was so clear that honestly my eyes hurt the first few days I wore them.  They do a great job at reducing glare as well.  I even wear them on cloudy days to enhance my vision.If you are looking to put down some bucks for a pair of sunglasses, these should be at the top of your list.\", 3136: \"Back when I wanted great Polarized shades, I decided between these and another brand. I chose the other brand initially. They looked ok but over time they felt cheap and barely stayed on my head when I would put them on my head or temples. Now I have a shaved head so I know, it's not meant to stay up there...but eventually I dropped the shades and my shades cracked. I called to get replacement lenses and was told they weren't in stock, call back in 1-2 weeks, but they may NEVER be stocked again. So I said, &#34;Let me get that other pair I wanted.&#34; I'm glad I did and wish I had made these my first choice. They're great, cover the eyes, I can almost stare directly in the suns path w/o squinting, and most importantly...these glasses feel like they're durable. I can even put them on my temples/head for a second and they don't budge. I'm glad they still had these when I went back to get them.\", 3137: 'The fit is perfect, quality of the lens is good. Would have been better if there was a hard shell case with the shades', 3138: 'I really like how the frame looks, REALLY wish the lens area was much bigger.. because they are not.. MAN they be THE sunglasses to wear imo if the lens area was much bigger..  but still not bad at all..', 3139: \"I couldn't be happier with these sun glasses.  I've alway been a big fan of Oakley, but not so much a fan of their pricing.  I tried these glasses on in a store near me and immediately wanted a pair.  I browsed different Ebay auctions and other sites advertising this pair of glasses and determined that Amazon had the best price for them, and much to my surprise the price was about $40 cheaper than what Oakley was asking for them.  I've gotten plenty of compliments on the sun glasses and couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase.\", 3140: \"Oakley has come out with so many variation of the the Crosshair. I've been trying to get a pair of replacement lenses for my wife for some time as her original lenses has peeled. Fits the original Crosshair. Finally this is the correct one. Wished that there could be more colors to select. Would love a pair in gradient brown.Noted a someone mentioned that the lenses of his Crosshair keeps popping out. This could be due to wear as the wire frames gets distorted. After some adjustments the lenses fitted nicely without popping out.\", 3141: \"These are good-looking glasses and are very light and fit well on a medium-large face. The optics are good too and provide clear and glare-free vision (thanks to polarization).The only things I didn't like:1) no case with a pair of glass that cost me $190! They just came in a microfiber pouch. I had to buy a case separately.2) Lenses are plastic. They should have been poly-carbonate or glass at this price point. I know glass adds weight, but the benefits of scratch resistance and better optics trump additional weight in my opinion (they would have been light with glass too, since the frame is very light). Secondly, since they are more dressy than sporty, glass would have made perfect sense.\", 3142: 'They have to be the best pair i have ever bought. the shade is just right in any light. Get them!!', 3143: \"I purchased these at the Oakley outlet mall in Wooburn, Oregon for the same price here. I had tried the polarized verision of these and didn't like them at all. But this style was just my fit. They feel big on your face and kind of are, but if you have a square set jaw they will look good on you. I saw these in the movie the Book of Eli (awesome movie, 5 stars) and had to see what they looked like on me. And yes I did consider purchasing the Dr Dre's beat inset headphones that Denzel wore in the film too. All and all I love these glasses.

The first two set of frames were broken or mangled beyond repair, but don't let that scare you off.  I beat the hell out of my sunglasses, so I'm amazed they lasted as long as they did.  I wear prescription glasses, so on sunny days, I am constantly switching between my regular glasses and the Oakleys.  I keep them in my pocket, and they come on an off 20-30 times a day.  And I am an opticians nightmare; a one-hander (I rip my glasses off one-handed and shove them in my pocket with one fluid motion.  My Oakleys are prescription glasses as well.  I purchased this set as a replacement for a frame that I broke in fight at a train station (I told you I'm tough on these things).  So, I my review doesn't really apply to the lenses, as I quickly removed them from the frame and replaced them with my custom prescription lenses.  The lenses that came with these frames didn't appear to have all the options that mine do (mirror-finish, stratch-resistant coating, etc...), so I'm not sure if its relevant, but I do absolutely love my lenses.  They cut glare and improve visibility on a cloudy Pacific Northwest winter day as well as they do in the blazing sun of the South Pacific (and I've used them in both scenarios).  I don't bother with ski goggles; these are better.\", 3147: \"Tried these on at a local store, but they didn't carry the color I wanted. They're comfortable and well made.

Good fit and not too tight for a slightly wider than average head.', 3151: 'Bought these sunglasses from Amazon based on on-line information only.  Great looking glasses, quick delivery, and great price.  Amazon got everything right again.  Of course Oakley brand sells itself.  Hope polarization feature is all that Oakley claims.', 3152: \"These are fantastic!  First, the quality of the polarized lenses are great.  I wear them to play golf and they make spotting my ball that much easier.  I've worn them at the beach and they greatly reduce glare from the sun off the water.  The frames are great quality as well.  I like how the arms grip on to your head.  They really keep the glasses from shifting if you are doing any activities.  The only negative I can say is the little bag that comes with the glasses will not protect them from damage.  Luckily, I have an older Oakley hard case to store them.\", 3153: \"I've previously had this these sunglasses and they fit well.

These sunglasses are as crisp and clean as looking at life without glass. They are sturdy, well balanced and comfortable, though some adjustment was required, and the guy at the store was spot on. They fit my fat face and, don't slip even in the slightest. There is always a concern when something is made in China that it's going to be cut-corner construction and simply cheap, but Luxottica didn't disappoint me the way Doctor Martin did. So in this case I am very happy. Are they overpriced? Prolly, but demand drives market value, and it's rare I find something that works for my oversized noggin and still looks good.\", 3158: 'Lightweight; can feel a little &#34;tight&#34; at the tips on the head for some, possibly due to the rubber at the tips; does not come with a hard case', 3159: \"I have always loved Oakley products, especially their polarized sunglasses. I've previously owned a polarized Half-Jacket which I misplaced - then went ahead and bought a couple of other cheaper polarized sunglasses. Needless to say, after experiencing Oakley, none of those were really good enough. I really missed the quality of the polarized lenses and the comfort of my lost Oakley. I guess there is a reason that Oakley products cost so much (and boy do they cost a bomb! I had to convince myself over many times to get another pair).This polarized Whisker is officially my second pair of Oakley sunglasses and from the moment I put it on, I knew I was going to love it. I've had it for over 6 months now, and still look forward to putting it on every chance I get. Don't let the thin-looking frames fool you, they are pretty tough and extremely comfortable to wear (though I would still advise against lumping them together in a bag with other hard stuff). I mainly use it while driving, and they do an excellent job of cutting the glares and reflections from other vehicles. They are also great when at the beach or other sunny spots - I live in a tropical country so when I say sunny, it gets very bright, especially at mid-day. At times like that, nothing beats the look and comfort of these Oakley sunglasses.The sunglasses come with a soft micro-fiber pouch that also doubles as a cleaning cloth and this is where I feel compelled to remove the 5th star. For a pair of premium sunglasses that costs this much, Oakley could have at least provided a sturdy / hard case free of charge, because if you are not extra careful it's easy to get the lenses scratched.All things said, these are definitely the best sunglasses I have ever owned. When it reaches its end of life, I would probably still go out and get another pair of Oakley!\", 3160: 'I bought these to replace a pair of Oakley Tightropes (loved them - but they are getting hard to find).

The style is nice, they scratch easily but very sharp looking.', 3162: \"I purchased these glasses during the holidays. They are amazing, I could not imagine wearing any others. I especially enjoy the fact that the lenses are polarized, this feature filters out many of the u-v rays that the sun produces and don't even notice it on sunny days.\", 3163: 'I love these sunglasses. I can not recommend them highly enough. Great frames, really good lenses and large enough in size they cover the entire eye.', 3164: \"This is really good sunglass. I have owned polorized sunglasses but polarized lenses on this sunglasses are really amzing. Even in most bight sun with reflections coming from water/ice is fully stopped.If you are driving in sun and it has just rained then you will definitely want these with you. Only annoying thing is its arm has rubber at the end to hold onto. But while removing those doesn't come off and it feels strange when rubber rubs on hairs.\", 3165: 'if you plan to buy a new sunglasses buy the one that has polarized its much better then the regular one and god for the eyesfor this purchase its the same price is you buy at any other stores amazon offer good prices on many other products but not this plus its looks like its going to brake any second', 3166: \"These are my favorite glasses ever. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than most, the weight and fit are perfect on my face.

I baught the same 4 year ago and i use it every day. The design is vers nice', 3168: \"Fairly decent pair of sunglasses, for the money. My only complaint is that like others had noticed, these are a tight fitting pair of sunglasses. The optics are nice, I just wish they had some arm flexibility in the form of a spring mechanism. These definitely won't come off during sports or other activities. I got them for 110 on a special from amazon, and don't think they are worth much more than that. Also, I think at this price they should include a case instead of some cheap fabric sleeve. Luckily I still have the case from my old Maui Jim's to use.\", 3169: 'It works as expected but is not much of a help with the late afternoon sun when the sun is positioned in front of your face.', 3170: 'I had a pair of these for five years.

LIke some of the other reviews I read there is somewhat of an issue when I first got them. They were to close to my eyes where my eyelashes were rubbing up against the lenses. That was an easy enough fix for me as I just bent and positioned them to the fit that I liked. The other thing is they are a bit heavy. But in the line of work that I do I have to have sunglasses on all day. I got to the point to where I didn't feel them on anymore. If you only wear them to go in and out and are always taking the sunglasses off then you ay notice the weight more than I do. These sunglasses are also a good look for men too. I see that on the Oakley website they have them marked for women. Well all the guys I work with have tried on my Oakley's and love them and have considered to buy a pair of there own. Excluding the pink ones of course.

I order a lot of stuff off Amazon and they usually have stuff cheaper and i decided to go on here(not knowing they carried the Oakley brand)and found them.

I really love this sunglasses\", 3210: 'Well I strolled into my LBS (Conte\\'s of Arlington VA) to look at either getting my two pair of Specialized Sunglasses repaired or replaced.  I had had great successes with the Specialized glasses except two things.  First, the lens on the San Remos, which theoretically, should be bombproof, was scratched and secondly, the frames of my second pair (San Remos) looked like the paint job of an old 2001 Ford Tempo.  I am tough on sunglasses so the scratch I understood but the red finish scratching and flaking to reveal the white frames was a little much, I digress because this is more to do with the Oakley Jawbones than it does reviewing a Specialized product.In the past, I had become accustomed, through a slow but continuous desensitization towards cost, to purchasing expensive but decent sunglasses.  The recommendation was made for me to look at the new Oakley Jawbones.  Now my experiences with Oakleys have varied in the past.  I had never purchased ones for cycling, but have used them as daily wear glasses and on a couple of tours to Iraq and Afghanistan.  My experience was that they were just okay, not something that I would run out and buy, and when given the opportunity to wear my $30 Under Armor glasses I picked up at Dick\\'s Sporting Goods or the most expensive Oakleys, I would take the Under Armor everyday of the week.  So on to the Jawbones.First, there was the price tag, almost $280.  This was for the custom frames that would match the team kit and the VR28 Blue Iridium Vented lens, without the custom frames it would be about $195.  Here is my first and only gripe about the Oakleys, there is not enough \"standard\" frame designs.  My opinion, only one of the four-color combinations offered off the shelf is not hideous, so custom is the only way to go.Out of the box, the Oakleys looked sharp.  You open them up and others gather round to gaze.  Presentation was awesome, case, lens, soft case, and the extra \"accessory\" lens.  When you pick the glasses up for the first time, they will feel a little bulky but that is the last time that you will even think of that and will only be reminded when first timers pick them up and ask.  Playing around with them in the LBS does not do them justice; it is the first time on the road that you can tell that you have bought a great piece of equipment.The first ride was a cool February morning, snow had melted off the streets, but water still glistened informing you that the first time behind the rider is going to cause a rooster tail effect of salty water in the face.  The glasses felt amazing, very light, full field of vision and fit the face perfectly.  The clarity of the lens was absolute.  The first opportunity for the group to paceline provided the next opportunity for test.  As water sprayed in my face and a quick wipe of the gloved finger across Oakleys Hydrophobic lens cleared the lens immediately, I remember being shocked that there were no streaks.  By the end of the ride, I was absolutely sold on the Oakley Jawbones.  Only for a brief second did they fog up at all.  We had done a really hard climb followed by a steep decent to a stop sign.  As I came to a stop and reached down to grab a bottle of Heed, the glasses fogged for a second, but they cleared equally as quick.  Not once did they fog during the ride.  I remember thinking, I cannot wait to try these in cyclocross where fogging has always kept me sans free on wearing eye protection during a race.The final sale, I pulled up to the truck to finish the ride, I took off my glasses and was blinded by the sunlight.  I remember putting them back on thinking, really?? That big of a difference? Yes, that big of a difference.  Therefore, I am sold, $280 for a pair of sunglasses, well worth the money.  Optimal comfort, no streaks, unbeatable clarity, these are legit!', 3211: 'The year was 2011. My team was hiking in the woods near mount Katy. Among my gear I was sure to include this very watch. For three hours a pulsating light appeared from above the canopy. We could hear a sharp ringing in our ears. The light became so previlent that we were blinded and unable to progress through the woods. I seemed to have  slipped into unconsciousness. When I awoke my team was gone, the only trace was a few teeth upon the ground. Also my watch was gone. And i found that it was now 2012. I do not know what happened during the missing time. I would not recommend this watch unless you are aware of what it attracts from the sky. Thank you for your time.', 3212: 'the watch is so cool and awesome, looks feels cooool, its oakley so we know the quality and its kinda heavy, i love it wife bought it for birthday', 3213: 'My husband loves this brand of expensive glasses and this particular one is no exception. I have also tried it on those really bright sunny days and find it feels comfortable and not tight around the ears/head. Also, it blocks the brightness of the sun very well and you are still able to see well in the shade. Another to note is that the frame is a little flexible meaning it can get bent but then you can bend it back to the original contour.', 3214: \"Great sunglasses.  Great fit.  I have trouble finding sunglasses that fit well and that I like.  These are both.  The only reason for 4 stars is that I wish they had the brown lenses.  As nice as these are I've found that brown lenses just produce a better visual perspective and color field than the gray ones.  But that's a small quible.  You won't be disappointed with these.\", 3215: 'I recieved these as a gift for christmas and i can say that the lens quality definitely matches up to those of ray-bans, even though the price is better. They came in the old style box and pink cleaning cloth/drawstring cover. They look great, although when you feel them they dont have a \"Made in italy\" feel, they are still very high quality and fit great (At least on my head). Also, the old style oakley logo looks really good.', 3216: 'I Love them. They are so much more comfortable than Ray Bans and look so much better. I Definitely recommend.', 3217: \"These are probably the most perfect sunglasses you could buy. They're extremely durable and fairly scratch resistant.

I have had Frogskins in other colors and they never fail to get compliments. They are classic looking and fit comfortably on my head.', 3221: 'I\\'ve previously owned (Ray-Ban) Wayfarers - which looks very similar to the Frogskins, in my opinion.Some differences I\\'ve found, between the two brands and models:Oakley Frogskins:- light weight;- sort of have a \"cheap\" feel (think of those 3D glasses they give at the theaters);- available in one size only;- Made in the United States;- comes with a cloth bag for storage;- cheaper than Wayfarers.Ray-Ban Wayfarer:- very nice, secure feel;- available in different sizes;- Made in Italy;- comes with a case;- expensive.Lens quality (on the polarized lenses) - on both models - is superb.So, I would say the Wayfarers are, overall, a bit nicer, but the Frogskins are also pretty awesome, and I love to use mine when driving.Which one to get? Just buy both, and pick one! :)', 3222: \"the sunglasses had a minor scratch on the frame when arrived...other than that, I'm pretty happy.  in case people are not aware, this lense is fairly light and your eyes can be seen.\", 3223: 'I looked endlessly at the myriad of choices for Frog Tongues on Amazon. I finally settled on this pair because I think the frames are super classy as well as timeless and can be worn to compliment all types of threads, from hoodies and sneakers to cardigans and oxfords.I also purchased the green lenses from Visionary Lenses and the combo is just sick.4 out of 5 because these shades feel like they will break very easily. But because they are so light, they are super comfortable to wear and your nose/ears do not fatigue.Have received all kinds of compliments since wearing them.', 3224: 'I bought these as a present for my brother for Christmas and he loves them! They are a great fit and look great!', 3225: 'All is good, lenses is not exactly darkened thus your eyes can be seen. recommended if you buying from countries that Oakley are priced too high.', 3226: \"I've only had these for a couple of days and perhaps one should bear that in mind while reading this review.I find these to be an excellent pair of sunglasses: they're extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear. The grey polarized lenses work very well and offer terrific protection for the eyes; moreover, the lenses aren't too dark, so it's possible to wear these indoors while sitting next to the window on a sunny day. The wearer's eyes are visible through the glasses but that doesn't bother me.There's no case, but the pair does come with a (fuchsia) storage bag that's also used to clean the lenses. Even though the frame is made of plastic, the build feels solid and I don't expect to have any issues with durability. For the price (for me the Amazon price was much lower than other retailers), I think this is a great pair of everyday shades, especially with the Polaroid lenses.And, oh yes, they look awesome.\", 3227: 'This is a nice value of sunglasses that i ever had.I would like to recommand this item to my friend.', 3228: 'i love the all plastic design of these glasses! lord knows i have a few too many cocktails and end up sitting on em when the sun goes down. that design saves me the time and money of getting new ones because they snap right back together! i wish i could find just the frames for eye glasses. love em!', 3229: 'the quality you have learned to expect from Oakley products. Great for wearing in the sun with snow on the ground. Great eye protection', 3230: \"these lenses are not very dark, but that is not a huge surprise to somebody who has looked at them on oakley's website.  being polarized, they are excellent at reducing glare.\", 3231: \"Got these shades after looking at a wide variety of options. I was considering persols and ray-bans, but in the end these are great. They are very lightweight, and have these stubs instead of screws, so when you sit on them or whatever, they just pop off. I've dropped them a few times, taken to the beach where I battled numerous foes in drunken wrestling matches (and lost, all of the matches I think), and they are still in perfect shape.Best of all, the lenses are magnificent. Stylish, sleek and a pretty good value. Pleased with my purchase for $117.\", 3232: 'Great sunnies, classic style!  Comfortable to wear and the polarised lenses are very crisp and clear.  I highly recommend them.', 3233: 'This are high quality, polarized, brown sunglasses.  They work really well and are easy to clean with just hand soap and water.  They are my third paid and the quality is amazing.  They can take a beating.', 3234: 'The title says it all.  They probably will never go out of style. The best part is they fit well and work like any other Oakley product does.', 3235: \"I have always been a Rayban Wayfarer fan until these! They're extremely hard to find because they made so few of them, but it's worth the search! They're more stylish than Wayfarers and provide an updated look with edge! They're also more functional than Wayfarers - they weigh less and offer polarization. It blows my mind why anyone would spend money on glasses that don't offer polarization - it's like living in the stone age. Great price, I bought 3 pairs! Black is my favorite.\", 3236: \"I originally wanted a pair of RayBan Wayfarers but since I am a great fan of Oakley sunglasses (and not the RayBan pricetag), I went with Oakley's rendition of the Wayfarer frame style.  These glasses are lightweight, look great, and the best part...are polarized! One of my favorite parts about these glasses is how they incorporate the old school Oakley logo and even include the old school pink microfiber bag. These glasses look and perform great.  I definitely recommend them.\", 3237: \"I was looking to get Ray Bans, but I'm glad I chose the Frogskins. They are light, durable, and freaking polarized. Love these glasses and couldn't ask for anything more. Seriously recommend these.\", 3238: 'I love the Oakley sunglasses.  They are excellent. However, I only rated 4 stars because the lens scratch so easy.', 3239: 'Simple yet tasteful in looks with some good lens that let you see in most light situations.

The lenses, however, do scratch very easily....keep them in a case when not in use.\", 3243: 'Bought these to replace another pair that my dog ate.

The HD Polarised lens's are outstanding, even on the sunniest of days you can see more clearly with them on than you can without them on a dull day. As for people whining about a 'flimsy' frame, don't be deceived.. the frame is extremely agile and designed for wear and tear as Oakley is a sports brand from its roots. The frame is made up fro O'matter which isn't any shoddy plastic.One final point, Oakley have only released 3000 pairs per model.. so they technically are limited.Definitely recommend, you are paying for quality.\", 3245: 'I received these pair of Oakley frogskin today and now I am in love with them. Honestly I am a huge fan of ray-ban but I found that the wayfarer were a bit too small on my face so I was looking for some other brand which offer retro-looked but still cool sunglasses. And I found these! Here are my reasons for in loving with the Frogskin.1. They are polarized lens sunglasses under $100! (why pay more for the same quality?)2. very light weight (I had rayban wayfarer before, they are cool but much heavier).3. They are very fun sunglasses with interchangeable lens and the temples.Highly recommended! You ll love them.', 3246: 'My wife was so excited when I got this for her and absolutely loves this jacket!

I need new lenses after a year but im fine with that.', 3248: 'Simply awesome glasses.  Comfort varies between those who wear them.  How can Oakley be such a bad product, yet be #1 in the world?

I know the day will come that they will not make them anymore... & I will be quite heartbroken.', 3250: \"The best pair of flips I have ever owned.  I always went for the cheaper, discount store pair, but now I know why they charge more.  Quality is very impressive and most comfortable flips I have ever owned.  They are worth every penny!!!  I would definately buy again.It is true what they say about getting the next size up.  I am normally a 11.5 or 12, but after reading the reviews, I decided to order in size 13.  Glad I did because I could see the 12's being to small.  Luckily these fit perfect.  Strongly reccomend that you do the same and order the next size up.Love Oakley sunglasses and love, love, love Oakley Flips!!!!!!!!!!\", 3251: 'The sizing information is right on, they run narrow and small, so order one size up.

They are also a great bargain!', 3252: 'I usually wear Reef Flip Flops, but I had some trouble finding the ones I love, so I went with these. I am super happy with the Oakleys!  They are so comfy, and fit really well to my feet! I am going to go with these now, instead of Reef from now on. I love these things!!!!', 3253: \"These sandals are nice looking and the footbed is fairly comfortable, but be warned if you're going to order listen to the advice of others and get them in a bigger size.  I normally wear 11.5 sized shoes and when it comes to sandals I usually get an 11.  These things really will run you at least a half to full size larger than normal.  I got mine in a 12 and they fit...barely.  I think a 13 would be too big (I've never purchased any shoe/sandal in my life larger than a 12) so I'm gonna keep them and see how it goes.  Also, it's important to note that in addition to the length issue there is also a width issue.  These things do run narrow.  Like a lot.  Again my feet barely fit them.  If you wear wide shoes consistently I would strongly advise you to go to a store and try them first as you could find yourself in ship return mode quickly.  The middle section where the strap meets the footbed is the narrowest part.  It's kind of strange that a big, high end company like Oakley didn't really look at these size problems from the get go.  It's too bad they don't come in half sizes as I would've ordered a 12.5 which honestly blows my mind to think about.  So as far as ratings go I give them 4 stars.  If they had better fitment I'd give them 5 stars as they have a nice look and appear to be made of decent quality materials.\", 3254: 'Item was exactly as described. It even came a day early! Great shoe- extremely comfortable!', 3255: \"I bought these directly from Oakley and wear them every day on our boat and around town. I am a big guy and beat the heck out of shoes, but these have outlasted every other manufacturer's. They've remained snug and totally comfortable and don't leave marks on the boat. They seem to run a bit small, which works for me.\", 3256: \"Small for me, I used a Oakley sandals and the size fit good, I don't know why this ones not\", 3257: 'be very pleased with this purchase I made very good quality product and excellent price the recommend. will stay at home', 3258: 'Very nice looking and very comfortable flip flops.

Had no expectations at all, and considering i spend $75 to $100 usually i was sorta skeptical. Well not anymore! They feel expensive,look expensive AND outperform expensive alternatives. They are form fitting(probably on the narrow side),but what really makes these special is the footbed. When they say it feels like memory foam,they mean it. It been 90 degrees every day since they arrived and i have worn them non-stop in every situation. Shopping, A Phillie's game,drinking at a pub,and a barbecue. Sometimes i forget they are flips. Literally,these flips have ample traction,low profile look,and mega comfortable shock absorption,plus the toe wedge is the easiest break in of any of the 60 pairs i have owned.

Well gus what this is my third product from them and It will not be the last', 3262: 'Comfortable and great quality material, but run a little short so try to get half a size o a size more.', 3263: \"ORIGINAL POST: 3 STARSFirst off, as stated in another review I read somewhere (I should have listened), they run small (and narrow).  I wear size 12 or 13... I ordered 13.  I shoulda got 14.  Right now, for the front end of my foot to be comfortable, my heels have to go all the way to the back end of the flip flops.  Because they are too small, I find myself pushing my feet towards the front, which really wedges that piece of material between your toes (which is very sturdy, but uncomfortable) right up against you.  Maybe after I wear them in a bit they will stretch out (theres a LITTLE extra room up front), but right now they're pretty uncomfortable to walk in.  They're also fairly heavy for flip flops, which I'm not too crazy about either.  They're about the same weight as a sneaker (I checked).  I will say that the cushioning is VERY comfortable.  If I had gotten a size bigger, I think I would have given them 4 stars.REVISION: 5 STARSOk, after a few months wearing these, they have become pretty comfortable and now my cheap flip flops seem TOO light to me.  These have started to contour to my feet, making the smaller size not an issue.  I like them a lot now.\", 3264: 'Came Quickly was told I would receive them after the new year, but I was lucky and received them December 28. No flaws with the shoes, takes a little bit to get used to the contours it has but after that they are one of the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn', 3265: 'I bought these and love them, very comfy, nice soles with good traction on the bottom, much better then the standard $4.99 target specials!!', 3266: 'gran producto muy comodas y se ven muy bien excelente acabado estoy contento de haberlas comprado las recomiendo ciento por ciento', 3267: \"it's a little bit expensive but this flipflop will sure last for years!!! fits well on the feet,i'll buy another color next time..\", 3268: \"I'm happy with the durability and comfort.  I'm a size 10.5 wide, I bought an 11 and it's good enough but almost on the too small side.  By a size larger than you think you need.\", 3269: 'muy bonito el producto de buena calidad duraderos bien elaboradas como sale en la pagina el color muy llamativo un poquito ajustada ala talla', 3270: \"The break-in period was a bit tough on my upper foot, but I suppose that's pretty common.  Overall it seems like a great sandal so far, no complaints.\", 3271: 'Really sharp and high quality. But I ordered a size 10 and too small. Reordering an 11 now! Hope to get a quick turnaround?', 3272: 'once you use to it they are really great, perfect comfort, well made, and good quality material. Exactly as described, good seller', 3273: \"I've had these for a year, wear them all the time in the summer, and they've held up great.  They never rub, or leave my foot with blisters.  Very comfortable to be in all day, even if you are walking the whole time.  They way they fit you can even run in them and they won't just fly off.  Very good product.\", 3274: 'I wear a 10 and a half shoe, so I bought a size 11 in this brand of flip-flop.  I just put them on and they are really, really SNUG.  So I would suggest buying a size larger than you would normally wear.', 3275: 'Very comfortable! Nice quality.  I payed attention to other reviewers and ordered a full size larger than what I normally wear, and they fit perfect.  Definitely a great buy.', 3276: 'These are very comfortable sandals.  They have a good sole and provides cushion when you walk.  The sytle is nice as well.  Oakley makes great products.', 3277: 'Look good and feel good with these amazingly comfortable and stylish flip flops.  They are very durable as well, lasted me two years before falling apart.', 3278: 'Such great shoes that they were stolen right from underneath my lifeguard stand while I was at work. Would buy again.', 3279: 'ordered a size 14 fits great holds up well against elements in afghanistan. would order again in a hearbeat. great sandal', 3280: 'Great for its use', 3281: \"I was looking for the same pair of Oakley men's sandals that I had previously bought at an Oakley discount outlet store... By purchasing them new from Amazon, I saved a lot of $$$!!!\", 3282: \"These Oakley Men's O-Strap Sandals fit my big wide foot perfectly...and the colorful footbed looks great too! Definitely a good choice for a warm day at the beach or on the dock.\", 3283: 'Nice flop, but my heel is right to the end.  Would recommend one size larger, great product though.', 3284: \"I've NEVER been one to buy something because of brand (Oakley is real expensive sunglasses) butthese are the best &#34;flip flops&#34; I've ever owned.  I love them!\", 3285: \"I was surprised to get them for $25 today and the size that I want.  After reading reviews on amazon, I was ready to buy online; however, I needed a pair of sandal right away, and I was willing & able to pay for the retail price for them.  Fortunately enough, the Oakley outlet was carrying them and many other pairs of Oakley sandal.So, now is the actual review:  I was looking forward to a pair of comfortable yet cool(temperature) sandal to replace my special pair of Crocs that I got at Macy's 2 years ago, but these got my feet pretty warm.  Since I was worrying about my constantly perspired feet, I didn't wear it them for too long.  I did notice that they're small for their size like other reviewers mentioned.  The salesman said that my feet were supposed to be tugged in.  IDK, maybe he was right.  After wearing them for a few weeks, they would probably stretch to fit my feet.  It's getting cold now, so I guess having a pair of warm sandals are okay for now.I would recommend these sandal.  Check out an Oakley Outlet if there's one within driving distance (call them first).  If not, Amazon would be your next best place to buy.\", 3286: \"I bought these for my husband for father's day this year to replace the Oakley sandals he bought a few years ago (because they had gotten lost while we were moving). When he saw them he was ecstatic because they are very well made and he remembered how comfortable his first pair was. They look nice and are great for walking around- my husband wears them all the time.\", 3287: 'I purchased these sandals a few days ago. I normally wear around a size 10 shoe, but after taking the advice from a reviewer of another Oakley sandal, I ordered one size larger. This turned out to be the right choice as the size 11 fits me nicely while any size smaller would have been way to small for my foot. As far as quality, these are top notch. This is the usual case when it comes to Oakley. If you are looking for a comfortable and high quality sandal, buy these.', 3288: \"These sandals are very comfortable and stylish.  I didn't have an issue with sizing as other reviewers did; I ordered my exact size and the fit was perfect.  In terms of appearances, the top looks slightly bulky, but in spite of that, the sandals are surprisingly light.  I would definitel recommend these!\", 3289: \"I had broken my foot and needed a pair of sandals with good arch support--and I lucked out when I found these.  Interestingly, the arch support is so expertly contoured that it doesn't feel like a support, which initially made me skeptical.  However, when I wear them (now, for instance) I am pain free, which certainly isn't the case with other sandals (or even shoes, unless I add an arch support insert).  They are also very rugged, easily washed, very adjustable with the Velcro band on top (though I haven't needed to adjust them), and darn, they look good, too (I bought them on sale and Chocolate was the only option in my size, but they turned out to be the best looking sandals I've ever had).  Oakley always seems to get it just right, and these sandals have greatly accelerated my recovery.\", 3290: 'I am on my third pair.  I use it everywhere.  Quality is outstanding and price is reasonable.  Not a \"cheap\" sandal.  Worth the cost.', 3291: 'I went out on a quest for a summer sandal and had no idea I would run into something like this.I bought these at a DSW for about $50 FYI. SZ 13. I wear 12.5 in most Nike and 13 in most Adidas for reference.I have been happy with most things oakley related, so I gave these a shot.They are a pleasure to wear! No issues with any part of the sandal that contacting the foot and creating excessive friction. This is a big plus!The sole is very easy to wear. Cushy, without being mushy. \"this  bed is just right\" kinda feel to them. I\\'ve been quoted \"it\\'s like walking on air\".Oh, and as my title says they have great lateral support! If you look at the pic, you will notice the straps on each side extend well past either side on the arch of the foot. This results in an ultra stable walking experience as each part of the foot makes/loses contact with the walking surface. They will not fall off, or shift significantly while walking! Major points for me.', 3292: 'Just got these things and put them on right away. i am a size 10 so i bought a size 10 because i figured the 11 would be way to big. they fit snug but not to snug to where it is uncomfortable... they are actually very comfortable and i am enjoying them on my feet. best sandal i have ever owned so far only time will tell still gotta break them in.', 3293: 'Great sandals! I bought these as a gift and was very pleased. I bought a number 10 for men and it was a bit tight so I recommend you add 1/2 a size to your order. Other than that BEAUTIFUL!', 3294: \"These sandals look great and are comfortable, but run a bit tight due to the thong's shape and placement.  Unfortunately, these aren't available in half sizes via amazon.com as of this time.  Also, the navy color of the sandal is not quite as dark as the image on the website; not a big issue, but just another thing of which to take note.\", 3295: \"Super comfy footwear that comes as advertised. For the money I'm not sure you can find a better sandal. Fits very well to your natural foot size( no need to order a size up or down). The arms that connect to the front thong sit at the sandals side rather than on top which make for a snug, yet comfortable, fit. I've had my pair now for a little over a month and it seems very durable, should last the test of time. Also they look just as good out of the box as they do on your computer screen. Basically if these are purchased it's money well spent.\", 3296: 'Good slipper, comfortable and nice color. The only downfall is that after a short while, the footbeds became slick and I have to clench my toes to keep my feet from sliding off the slippers when I walk.', 3297: 'Perfect fit, very comfortable, and good looking.  A great product for the price.  I would definitely buy again and recommend!', 3298: \"Well, the picture here doesn't do the shoe justice bc the shoe is dark/rich black and looks lush.  The leather is very nice and the fit is very true/comfortable.  Excellent padding and the clutch pedal feels great on the platform of this shoe.  The bottom grip is, well, the grippiest racing shoe I have ever worn, period.  Casual walking around is also pleasant.  The support in the heel area is rather firm and doesn't depress much. The laces and tongue are top notch. The only possible negative could be excessive creases in the leather where it arches on top by toes, but just buy some leather lube and apply it weekly.Note: Just got back from a night out, standing for hours, my feet feel like heaven, seriously.\", 3299: \"I've worn glasses since I was 2 years old and for the next 37 years i always struggled with getting glasses to fit and stay on correctly.  After a while the glasses would feel sprung and I'd worry about them slipping down my nose when doing active things (hiking/camping and woodworking mostly).  These are the first glasses i've owned that after a year of wear still fit snugly on my head. I love them so much i just bought a second pair as a backup and another pair of sunglasses!\", 3300: \"I love my Oakleys yet dislike how quickly the ear pieces wear out. Buy two packs of these at a time, you'll thank me later.\", 3301: 'Excellent product, really uncomfortable unique is that the only provider that offers all amazon this article does not have variety of colors, I had to buy the black combs when in fact my lenses are brown.', 3302: 'The item arrived speedy quick and they made my 10+ year old Oakley sunglasses good as new!  A little soapy water make the ear socks to on very easy.', 3303: 'This product arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. Have had my pair of XX for 6 years or so and the rubber was starting to get a little shabby. Along with this I ordered a pair of replacement lenses directly from Oakley so my sunglasses will be like new. The price for this is a bit high (and getting higher. . . I think when I purchased this it was only $12 but is now around $18). Oakley sold these for $10 but have discontinued them so I was glad to be able to obtain the kit. If you are looking to freshen up or repair your old Oakleys this might be worth it depending on how much you like the sunglasses. It was for me.', 3304: 'Exactly what I needed.  For $20 my 10 year old Oakleys look great.  Same style is not sold again but has misc changes.', 3305: \"Purchased to replace my old worn out pieces on my oakleys. It's nice to have them fit like new again. Great product!\", 3306: 'I found out that this kit is not available from Oakley. This is exactly what I was looking for. Price was too cheap but the freight charges was way too high. Seller should adjust prices accordingly. Still well worth the investment and I would recommend replacing them before they are all gone.', 3307: 'Once I figured out how to get the earsocks on my Oakley XX sunglasses (a little soap and water on the stems) they fit perfectly and with the new nose pads make my favorite sunglasses look as good as new.  I was thinking of buying the new XX (Twenty 2012) but at $180 at Sunglass Hut and over $130 on Amazon, simply replacing the earsocks and nosepads on my original XX for less than $25 including shipping was a much better option.  The shipment arrived only 8 days after I placed my order and I am very happy with the product!', 3308: 'They fit perfectly, a little soap and the ear sleeves went on easly. My Oakleys look like new again. Fast shipping too.', 3309: 'This is not the original that came with my Zeros, but those were awful. This should work better. Oakley makes great stuff.', 3310: \"I saw the other review, and I almost didn't purchase because of it, but the nosepiece fits PERFECT. Granted though, it does NOT include the 2 small nosepieces, just the SINGLE piece one. Saved me from having to buy new shades, so A+ from me!\", 3311: 'For the people who love oakley design, this model is almost classic. I just dont know why they dont have the silver color. So this is the closest to silver you re gonna get. I have two pair of this model glasses in different colors. So you made your own conclusions.', 3312: 'This jacket has it all...big fit, long steeves, magnets insead of velcro (I hate velcro), lots of pockets, detachable hood, solid color (patterns will date a jacket, but solid colors are ALWAYS IN FASHION), and tons more features.', 3313: \"The dispatch sunglasses are the only sunglasses that fit my giant head. They fit perfect and look very nice. Unfortunately, Oakley decided to change the design and make the Dispatch II. They don't fit like the originals, so I bought a few more pairs of the Dispatch, since I won't be able to buy them anymore. Oakley still sells lenses for the Dispatch on their web site. So you better stock up if you like these glasses. Unless Oakley decides to start making them again. Which is unlikely.\", 3314: 'e x c e l e n t e s  l en t e s  d e  m a r a v i lla', 3315: \"I ordered these shades and a few different lenses to go with them. I have a fairly large head so these worked out great for me, light weight and they go well with everything. Can't go wrong with black shades.\", 3316: 'So I wanted to buy this glasses for casual use. I tried them a few times and got to know they are bulky compared to some other glasses but they fit well enough to buy them. These are not your tipical aviators fellas, these are perfect for wear at the beach with boardshorts, a pair of vans or very casual-sport use. I have been using them with care and, to be honest withstood very well  a couple of light drops, my fault. Well made, nice quality, now I know why they have such price tag. Definitely worth it. By the way they do not fit everybody, so try before buying. Then enjoy.', 3317: \"I've had these Dispatch sunglasses for several years and they are great! They are very comfortable on my face - they are not heavy on the bridge of my nose and the temples bars fit firmly but comfortably and I can forget I have them on.  The lenses are big enough to cover all my field of vision.  I have the grey lenses and they really are easy on my eyes - I don't get eye fatigue as I sometimes do with the color tinted lenses.The only negative is that these do NOT have polarized lenses and even the replacement lenses available from third parties are not polarized, so be aware of that.  They would be worth five stars if they were polarized. These are simple, plain sunglasses.I've had various Oakleys for 15 years and only buy Oakleys because they are comfortable and are quality.\", 3318: 'Are these oversized?

Great quality, great product. I bought these sunglasses because they were Oakleys and they looked sick, but when I received them I found out that the lenses were actually really good quality. It doesn't make everything look really black, but just dims what you see so you still have great vision. Instead of those other sunglasses where they look nice but you can't see a thing, these sunglasses look great but you still have great vision too. All in all, great product.\", 3320: 'The glasses are amazing! I had only seen on the face of some people ... I bought without trying!

I passed them up because they werent that great looking... when I saw the white ones, I had to get these. I can't believe that a color change was all what was needed in order for me to get them. The frames and lenses are large enough to cover my eyes... it definitely works with my round face. And I never realized how hot these looked until I tried them on! I read these are aviator style sunglasses, but i really cannot agree with that. They are boxier than the aviator model.I am really thrilled that i have found the sunglasses that fir my face and cover my eyes well, unlike my Oil Rigs (which I love despite the flaws).\", 3323: 'I love Oakley glasses because of their quality and design and this pair continues to prove why I love Oakleys.', 3324: 'Every person that sees this pair tell me the same thing \" those are Hot!\" Must say I do agree!', 3325: 'I been browsing for OAKLEY sunglasses that fits big head , and i came across with the dispatch .

I require my sunglasses to work as a headband also, and these do a great job!\", 3338: 'These glasses are amazing the polarized lenses make everything look so sharp and clear. Use when I golf and have no issues with distance.', 3339: 'Perfect fit! I have a small face and head and these glasses fit snug to my face and sides of head.

Oakley doesn't have any thick-rimmed metal framed sunglasses at the moment (at least that I could find, in my price range), so I settled on the Fuel Cells.  Of course I went into a retail venue to try them first, and when she bent the arm back on itself and it didn't break, safe to say I winced, but was very impressed.  One main thing I wanted to upgrade on was comfort, as my prior two pairs of Os did start to hurt my big head after a while and I'd have to take them off & give my head a break.  I've worn these for hours at a time and wouldn't even know they're there if not for the purpose they serve.  They're very light, and don't pressue on the sides of your head after any amount of time.  Also, Oakley seems to have improved their lenses since I bought my Spikes 7 years ago.  The tint is a little more brown than gray, but they are also much more clear.  It's like the glasses are just blocking the glare that pains your eyes and not detracting from the natural visual in any other way, which is a welcome improvement.  Overall I'm very pleased with these glasses, and to save a chunk off retail is an even bigger win.\", 3361: \"I love these sunglasses!I receive compliments on them at work almost daily. They fit great and don't slide off my face.

They are high quality and are very sleek looking. I like the dark shades on them and although they're labeled as grey, they're pretty much all black. They're really dark all around which is good because that is what I was looking for. I couldn't turn down the price even though I was gambling on the color some.

Very nice sunglasses that sit well, don't cause any pain/'hot spots' on my nose or ears, and take the glare off my eyes.

They fit well on my face and are comfortable (I have a pretty big, round face and these glasses are perfect). The best part is that I can change out the lenses when they get scratched without have to replace the frames unlike other sunglasses.  My suggestion is try them on first at the stores to see if they fit well before you shell out your money.  In my opinion, they are a little expensive but well worth it.', 3394: 'I work on water, so the polarized option was no question. At my local surf shop, where I was trying them on, I mentioned I wanted reflective and/or dark lenses. The guy helping me handed me these, with the iridium lens on top of the polarized component. They literally presented life in a new light. Crisp images, no warping, truer colors and greater clarity/definition. I find myself wearing these in hazy/foggy/gloomy conditions just as comfortably and dependably in extreme light conditions. The frames are a bit large, when I smile they raise because the position changes and they sit on my cheeks, and I have horrible tan lines, not unlike reverse racoon eyes. If you can ignore these silly side-effects, they are absolutely worth the money; ESPECIALLY on amazon (I paid a lot more when I got mine, they were new to the market and at the store front...).', 3395: 'Great!

This time the Oakley phone rep informed me that the Warm Grey lenses were no longer available, and that I'd have to switch to his recommendation of the the Black Iridium lenses. (I'm a pilot and cannot use polarized lenses). **BEWARE** The Warm Grey lenses are MUCH better at filtering out light and have a MUCH more pleasant tint. The Black Iridium feels like you are looking through a cheaply tinted car window. They also have a horrible mirror finish while the Warm Grey lenses are flatter and more subtle. I ended up having to order the Warm Grey lenses separately and at an additional cost. If you are considering ordering custom or just want the best pair of non polarized lenses go with the Warm Grey. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the Black Iridium.\", 3416: 'I normally wear a 7.75\" fitted hat and these sunglasses actually fit my big head, unlike some other sunglasses I\\'ve tried out.

I did not compare these to non-polarized lenses so I can\\'t comment on whether or not there is a difference between the two.Fit is going to be extremely individual but these are not as tight on the temple as their older wires.  This is something to consider if you are going to wear these under a helmet so be sure you can return them if that becomes an issue.  They are extremely light.  The optics are very clear.

That day I had arrens to run, and man did they work great, no glare, no blinding light anywhere! I am very happy with these, and the price was just what I could afford. Thanks Amazon for having these in stock, they were much more expensive elsewhere. I would recommend these glasses for everyday use. Thanks again!Larry', 3497: 'I bought these for my husband because his last pair of Oakleys he had for seven years and it was time for an upgrade. These came way before the expected date and were in great shape. On the Oakley website they were $200 so I was super excited to find them on Amazon. My husband LOVES them and has gotten tons of compliments. They look great and fit well!', 3498: 'I received my sunglasses in time, and they where just as I imagined them from the pics, also the price I got was much better than the store.', 3499: \"WOW...I don't normally write product reviews but I felt obligated in this case.  My old pair of Oakleys had non-polarized lenses and these (Dark with Ice Iridium polarized lenses) are simply AMAZING.  I echo previous comments about lack of a hard case but I had one already so no big deal in my case.  I do recommend that you pick one up if needed, it's well worth the investment.Shipping was quick (ordered Sunday afternoon, arrived Tuesday just after noon) and the Amazon price was great (previous purchase at Sunglass Hut was well over $200).All in all, 5 stars!\", 3500: \"Sturdy frame (unlike some other Oakleys I've had in the past).  Can't go wrong for the price in my opinion.\", 3501: 'I updated my Oakley sunglasses to get a better fit around my eyes since I wear contacts and my last pair left a gap that caused my contact lenses to dry out. These work perfectly.', 3502: \"I just love this product. Great product from Oakley, The lenses gives real cooling effect to my eyes, i feel a big difference every time i wear it (looking outside with and without the glasses) The design is so good that the frame doesn't hold you so tight and is very comfortable(even if you wear it for a long drive). The styling is good and suits my small face too. Overall a great buy. 100% value for money. I highly recommend it.\", 3503: 'Nicely constructed pair of sunglasses.  The polarized lenses are great in the sun and really reduce the glare.  Just a couple of observations... the finish on the frames has held up remarkably well.  The overall size of these is a tad small.  They initially came shaped so that the frame wraps around your face.  I had them adjusted so they are a little more &#34;straight&#34; across and they seem to look a little bigger on the face (a good thing).  Overall, these are awesome sunglasses.  I find myself very protective of them because they are not cheap!', 3504: 'Solid piece of eyewear that both performs its main function and gets compliments for its looks.  A little bit on the pricey side, though.', 3505: 'Great sale, This product was in great condition and was a fast shippment! Would recommend this sealer to anyone that wants good products fast.', 3506: 'I just recieved these Oakley sunglasses I purchased for my husband for his birthday. Wow! Very nice. I know my husband is going to love them. They are exactly what you see on picture. His type of style and great quality!', 3507: \"These are the Oakleys that I liked many years ago and were taken from me or lost.  I am very happy with these glasses and I am enjoying the high quality of workmanship.  Excellent price!!  I couldn't even find these at the Oakley stores.Thanks Amazon!!\", 3508: 'Super cute sunglasses. Got these for my bro and they r awesome... They arrived on time and looks elegant whenever he out them on!', 3509: \"These Oakley Tightrope Sunglasses are Fantastic! They have a comfortable fit, the frame is sturdy, the lens are clear and great at blocking out the sun's glare. The price was good and they surpass my expectations! I should have bought these awhile ago.\", 3510: \"Overall great product, shipped very quickly and arrived on time. They look awesome and are cheaper than buying from stores.2 small problems though.1.) The case is well.... not a case. Its just a soft cloth pouch, which will offer basically 0 protection. You're gonna probably want to find a hard case to store these in. Considering that Oakleys are a very expensive brand, you'd think they would throw in at least a semi-hard case, but alas, no.2.) If you have a large head, these will be a tight fit. One size only on these so good luck!\", 3511: 'Bottom line: this is my second pair ... I would have given it 5 stars if not for the fact that Oakley is not selling replcament lens for it', 3512: 'Oakley is a brand you can trust especially if your skin is sensitive like mine which make me obligated to use glasses with materials which dont harm my skin and I found Oakley perfect for me. it looks awsome on my face but pretty tight in comparison with \"Fives\" model which is plastic by the way.If you have bigger face avoid it otherwise  you will love it.', 3513: \"I was concerned when I first received them as the external box was in perfect condition but the internal box was completely damaged.  Looked them over -- did not see any issues.  My husband's Christmas gift-- Loved them!\", 3514: 'This past summer was a horrible summer for any sunglasses I touched. I went through about a dozen cheap pairs that I picked up from local brick and mortar stores. Sitting here I realize that, if I were to add up the cost of all these cheap sunglasses, I could of bought a couple of very nice pairs. I have only owned cheap sunglasses and I wondered if paying a premium on sunglasses is worth it.Enter the Oakley Mens Tightrope sunglassesI picked these up because they came to my attention being apart of a sale. I was hesitant due to even the sale price but, as I mentioned beforehand, just a few cheap pairs would cover the cost of these glasses.They arrived in the mail and come pre-packaged in a simple cardboard box. Within the cardboard box the glasses are protected in a soft cloth bag and also contain a cleaning rag and small info brochure.I immediately pulled out the glasses and spent the next few hours walking around trying them on and, have to say, I am pretty impressed.Many of my cheap glasses broke due to poor construction of the frames. These frames feel durable and like they will last. I have a large head that does put tension on glasses. These glasses were able to take the tension yet retain their original shape.The glasses are not polarized but do a good job on their own protecting my vision from the suns glare. The lenses are the perfect tint and did not block out my vision of the outside world.I received compliments from my wife and neighbors about how stylish the glasses look. It reminds me of the hoopla during the 80\\'s when Tom Cruise sported \"Aviator\" glasses from the movie Top Gun and the craze he created.PRO:++ Durable construction++ Compliments on how stylish they lookCON:++ For price, only receiving a cloth bag for protection is cheapCONCLUSION:These glasses are well worth the premium paid over regular sunglasses you find sitting on a carousel rack at the local brick and mortar stores. Just watch for the sales when they go on to pick up then.', 3515: \"Not much to say, but it's nice glass, fit's well on my head (FAT HEAD :) )The polarized effect is good for drivingThe glass is good to use on high sun or on a foggy day (White color makes my head hurts)\", 3516: \"I am one who buys the cheap pair of sunglasses because I break and lose them. I am earning more money so I went on a limb and bought these sunglasses. They fit so well, the polarization is fantastic. The glasses themselves just feel expensive the way they fit on my head. I had them for three weeks while in Afghanistan and received many compliments. One day I fell to sleep on the bus on the way back to my room and woke up not knowing I left them on the bus. That was six months ago. Since then I was buying those cheap sunglasses again but I swear some seem to allow the sun right through like a magnifying glass burning my retnas. I broke down and bought another pair of these Oakleys and my god I already forgot how well made they are. From this point on I will not buy another cheap pair of sunglasses. I also have a pair of Raybans but the Oakleys just look and feel great!!!I only gave this a four star rating because it comes in a cloth bag.  Oakley Tightrope Men's Polarized Active Fashion Sunglasses - Dark/Ice Iridium / One Size Fits All\", 3517: \"I like the sunglasses but I swear I ordered polarized lenses and did not get them.  Also, it took a long time to get the glasses.  They were a better deal online then through the store, but if I'd known it would take so long to get them I would have just bought them locally.\", 3518: 'The sunglasses arrived in a timely manner and were advertised accurately. The are comfortable and have a very sleek appearance. They were also competitively priced.', 3519: \"Oakley's Tightrope Metal sunglasses are a quality product. Crystal clear lenses and good eye coverage. Recommended without reservation. Provide good eye protection in a fashionable pair of sunglasses.\", 3520: \"Can't stop using it. I love the black polorized lens compared to the OO Black. The frame is just so solid! Brilliant !\", 3521: \"Fits, good quality. Looks good. But I also bought a pair of Foster Grants @ Costco for $19.95. Quite less than $195 for Oaley's. Experts could tell the diffrence. I am not an expert.\", 3522: 'These were a great fit for my husband who has a narrow face and closer set eyes.  The color is slightly deceiving online, they are definitely more of a brown color than the color pictured so if you are looking for black or grey these definitely are not for you.  Nice and lightweight as well.', 3523: 'Great fit, great clarity.  The nose piece needed to be adjusted a few times, but once I got that takenn care of, no problem.  Great sunglasses.Definitely invest in the Oakley Vault for them too.  All metal frames can get bent easily.', 3524: 'These retail here (UAE) for around USD 300. They fit perfect and they look good, typical Oakley quality. No complains whatsoever. Highly recommended.', 3525: 'Are you burdened with an over abundance of money?  Looking for something to spend some of it on?  Are you constantly depressed because your friends and co-workers have more expensive sunglasses than you?  Did a woman ever say to you \"I would totally go out with you, but your sunglasses are just way too cheap\"?Here is your answer.  Wear these and closed doors will open.  Women will want you and men will want to be you.  If the movie \"The Book of Eli\" was ever to happen, everyone knows that when the apocalypse happens the only things separating the Sword and Shotgun-toting heroes from the monomaniacal dictators is a pair of Oakley sunglasses and the ability to read Braille.  And you can\\'t buy fluency of Braille on Amazon.Ok, reality check.  These sunglasses are no better or worse than any of the other offerings from Oakley.  They are fully UV rated and have all of the typical benefits and drawbacks of the Oakley marque:  USA made, outstanding optical clarity, phenomenal impact resistance, the exclusivity of the Oakley brand, sweat and oil resistant hydrophobic lens coating, and the usual problem with the lenses scratching when exposed to anything other than a clean room.  BUT, and it is a big BUT, these are made of that magical metal Titanium.Following in the groundbreaking footsteps of the Juliet, Mars, X-Metal XX and Penny, the X-Squared is an absolutely gorgeous mix of style and functionality crafted and finished by hand in Titanium, a metal that is stronger than steel, almost as light as Aluminium, and will not rust or corrode.  Even if you don\\'t buy in to the marketing hype of Oakley, Inc. you gotta admit, these really do look good.  Yes they are expensive, and replacement lenses will set you back $50-$165, and a factory tune up of hinges and nose piece gaskets will cost $70 but when you hold these in your hand you really do get the feeling that they will last.  And if you are actually considering buying a $400 pair of Oakley sunglasses then either you are a compulsive Oakley collector who is willing to eat ramen noodles for a month or two to be able to add these to the collection, or you have arrived in life and things like expensive replacement lenses don\\'t matter.  Either way, they are worth it.These are one of the few styles of sunglasses that look good with a suit and tie, or jeans and a t-shirt.  They are durable, comfortable, well made and include different types of nose pieces and ear piece spacers to ensure a proper fit.', 3526: 'One of the nicest sunglasses ive ever owned and oakley has one of the best repair policies on the market.This is the 4th different pair i own .Highly recommended!', 3527: 'Amazing glasses.* Maid in USA* High quality* Durable* The nose piece design is impressiveCons:* It was $40 or 50$ cheaper few weeks back!* Bulky, cannot fit in the sun glasses holder in any car!Overall, i would buy it again. In fact i lost mine and bought another identical one :|', 3528: \"I've wanted a pair of Oakley X Metals since I was in high school(x-men).  After spending $60-80 on cheaper glasses, and then breaking them or getting them all scratched up, I decided it was time to buy these, reportedly, indestructable X Squareds.  They are AWESOME.  They are strangely light feeling, when you consider how strong they are.  To the touch, they feel similar to ceramic, and they're almost always cold.  The fit is a little snug, but my previous shades were Under Armour impulse, and they were considerably tighter than these, though not as heavy.  The only problem I have with them is that you really can't slide them on with one hand.  They WILL scratch the sides of your head.  So, if you have a toddler, as I do, you'll need to put them on before picking up the baby.  I've had them for a few weeks now, and they are simply the best sunglasses I've ever had.  When the lenses get too scratched, I'll buy some replacement lenses and keep wearing them.Amazon really impressed me with these. First off, the price was almost $100 cheaper than buying them directly from Oakley.  I ordered these with 2 day shipping, which was only like $8.  They arrived on time, but the seal on the bottom of the box was broken, and it looked like the glasses may have been handled, or even worn before.  Also, the ruby lenses looked mostly yellow and orange, rather than red.  At 10pm I sent ONE email to customer service, explaining the details and asked if I could exchange them.  Within an hour I received an email back, explaining that they we sorry, and that they had already shipped another pair OVERNIGHT, free of charge.  The following afternoon, I received the second pair.  The seal on the bottom was also cracked a little, but my guess is that both were broken in storage, transit, or handling.  They seemed untouched since the factory, and have much, much redder lenses.  These also came with a different bag, which I figured out later, is the newer model.  The bag with the large tag on the bottom is the older one.  I printed out the return shipping label emailed to me, and dropped off the first pair at UPS.  Now, my only problem is convincing my wife to get me the Ducati edition for my birthday...\", 3529: 'Awesome sunglasses, worth every penny, its light weight. the design is also amazing, its better than the juliet in my opinion, juliet is a little too small...', 3530: 'These Oakley X Squared sunglasses are AWESOME and worth the expense. I gave them a 4 out of 5 stars not because of the actual sunglasses but because the package seal was broken and the sunglasses look like they were opened. They were listed as brand new and because of the tapped up seal over the original seal (which was broken) I naturally wonder if they have been used or worn before. The sunglasses still appeared brand new, but they probably should have been listed as \"new- other\" or something like that. All in all, the shipping was quick, sunglasses are great, price was unbeatable, but I just have a thing about buying anything even slightly used or the possibility of use.', 3531: 'does it come in a box with a x-metal coin? if someone could tells me that, because i want to buy the sunglasses i like them but i wanna know if they come with the box with the x-metal coin.', 3532: \"My new favorite among the X-metal lineup compared with Juliet, XX, half X, etc. Light-weight titanium alloy with interchangeable lenses, the polished frames are the sleekest in its class in my opinion.

What XLJ means is that these have more coverage underneath the lens as well as on the sides. The standard Flak Jacket lenses are slightly more compact. I needed to switch my nose pads to use the XLJ lenses when I first swapped from standard to XLJ. For those that purchased their Flak Jackets new, you should have received in the box a Flak jacket vault with the foam inserts for the lenses, and an extra set of nosepads that are thicker.The Positive Red Iridium coating pops out more than Black Iridium, Grey, or VR28. However, the actual lens tint is neutral, just like Black Iridium. I tried Fire Iridium and some of the other tints, but they actually change the lens tint (it looked green with the Fire Iridium) which distracted me. The only colored lens tint that works well for me was VR28 and VR28 Black Iridium, as it provides better contrast without changing the color of objects. That said, Positive Red Iridium is the same as Black Iridium in terms of lens tint and light transmission, except it looks snazzier.Overall: 5/5 stars, perfect fit on my Flak Jackets. I do have to use the thicker nose pads with XLJ lenses.', 3538: \"Oakley replacement lenses fit as expected.  Oakley frames oakley lenses, can't go wrong.  Will buy again if needed.

I use them at an indoor range when I go and shoot my glock and .22 pistol. The ammo I usually put through that poor .22 is crappy at best, so I get a lot of unspent powder every where. These lens take the punishment and keep my eyes safe. Also a few times I have had cartridges eject funny and hit me directly in the lens. Very minimal if any scratching to the lens. These lens are super tough and durable. A great buy for anyone looking to protect their eyes and increase their indoor vision while shooting!', 3541: 'I purchased these lenses for when I bike in low light conditions. It also works well on cloudy days. I got exactly what I was looking for.', 3542: 'The color is exactly what I wanted, and the size fits exceptionally well.

Would love a locking mechanism of some kind but the bag is light and scratch proof as it is.', 3554: 'Ok, its a bag for cleaning eyeweares, nothing more. It do its work in a spectacular way. it should come more bags when buy an oakley, lost very often...', 3555: \"I was looking for a soft sunglass case to carry my shades in to toss in my purse and this case fits the bill perfectly. The case is roomy and fits my shades well and doubles as a cleaning cloth, which was a bonus. I do wish that the drawstring had a catch to it to help it stay closed, but I haven't had any problems with the shades sliding out, so it works as expected. I would definitely recommend this product.\", 3556: \"I love Oakley glasses.  The Zero is however one of my favorate.  I have a smoke pair and was looking for a brown.

I hope I can find some polarized in yellow.', 3558: \"I've been trail riding through thick woods in the late afternoon/early evening. I needed something to enhance contrast to enable me to see obstacles in the challenging light conditions. These vented lenses are wonderful. They aren't night vision goggles, but the next best thing. During high speed drops, I can pick out a lot more detail on the trail than I could with clear lenses.They come with a small plastic envelope that keeps the lenses apart when stored. Nothing glamorous, but it helps protect the lenses while in a pack or pocket.\", 3559: 'The amber lens tint  that darkens slightly is perfect for skiing and snowboarding.  Just used in Colorado in my Jawbones with the Wind Gasket.

Also, they shipped very fast.', 3566: \"If you are considering aftermarket lenses for your Oakley, my recommendation is stop. Proceed on your own risks. I did, and had to return them a week later. The aftermarket lenses are about half the cost of this pair, and seemed to work fine at first until I ride with the sun at an angle to my face. Too much glare, so much that it became dangerous to ride. I replaced the lenses back with a pair of Oakley lenses and the glare was reduced at least 90%. I tested the Jawbone again with this pair of lenses and result was the same, nice, clarity and quality you come to expect of Oakley.The aftermarket lenses work great when it is cloudy or in the shade, such as when you are driving a car. Since you never always ride in the shade, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $35 for this pair of authentic Oakley lenses.One thing: it's the wrong picture on Amazon web site! I was pleasantly surpised to find that this is the VENTED version of the lenses and really designed for riding (a bicycle).\", 3567: \"I have eye damage from an autoammune disorder and am extremely light sensitive. I have found the Oakley Jawbone sunglasses to be the most effective sun blocker on the market, and believe me I've tried most. I like riding my bike and walking so I found the lenses with vents in them to release fogging-up to be very helpful. It does not take care of all fogging-up in heavy exercising, but most of it. This item is pricey but well worth the money spent.  I ordered these polarized lenses to go with my set, all lenses are interchangeable. Amazon, as usual, carried the best buy I could find on the net.\", 3568: 'I exchanged the black ones I had purchased prior for these. This color is pleasantly neutral and cuts the glare no matter how bright it gets here in Arizona. These came quickly and in the proper packaging.

The world around me seems a whole lot clearer now.\", 3580: \"Based on the other online reviews, I've been careful handling the glasses.  So far, no trouble at all.  My optometrist wasn't an Oakley dealer so I picked up the frames online and had them order the lenses through their lab.  The glasses are very light and the straight temples don't require any adjustments like a temple with a bend.\", 3581: 'These lenses were the cheapest Oakley brand replacements I could find after my original polarized lenses started to peel. One lens was minutely smaller than the other, noticed only when snapping it into the frame because it would snap in and out easier than the other.

These replacement lenses fit perfectly in my glasses.', 3585: 'When I was a teenager I used to work in a sunglass store so I learned a lot about sunglasses and all the different features and importance of protecting your eyes. While sunglasses are mostly used for vanity reason, I believe the most important part role that sunglasses have is the protection levels they offer. You ,need to have a sunglass that protects the eyes from harmful UVA & UVB rays. As we age our eyes are more vulnerable to these harmful rays. Sunglasses that protect from both UVA/UVB rays acts like sunscreen for your eyes. Many people buy sunglasses that only protect UVA and not both. It is very important that the sunglass protects against both. You dont want the harmful rays from the sun to burn your eyes as it can be damaging and irreversible. Oakley sunglasses have an amazing reputation for making a quality lens that protects your eyes from both UVA/UVB. Oakley is known for making sunglasses and goggles for snow skiing and snow related sports. They make a top quality lens aling with amazing colors and styles for the frames. I like that Oakley is one of the few sunglass manufactures that offer didnt colored lenses to change out in your frames. Different colored lenses are another essential role is eye protection. While skiing you need a certain colored lens to help protect yet to see where you are traveling down hill. I love that Oakley allows you to purchases \"parts\" for your sunglasses. So if you break the nose piece you can order a new nose piece. If the arm needs to be replaced you can do so. I love that Oakley hasnt changed the amazing colors they use for their eyewear. I used to have hot pink frames with the smoke colored lens and I love them. So when I saw this pair of Oakleys I knew I wanted to have them. This particular pair has a rose colored lens which is great for snow.I\\'m very happy with my purchase. The bottom line here is to purchase sunglasses for protective reason first the for vanity reason. Spend more as you will get more. Ten dollar sunglasses are not going to have the same protection eyes need. If you purchase Oakleys they have great customer service and tbey stand behind their product.

Also looks great on my wife for our anniversary, thanks and we will be getting more products from you.', 3587: 'These replacement rubber pieces were exact fits.  The new rubber made my half jacket frames look brand new with my new lenses!', 3588: 'Works as advertised. 2 different sized sets of nose pieces.  Great for asian or standard fit Half Jackets.', 3589: 'These replacement pieces fit my Half Jacket Oakleys perfectly.  I used hand sanitizer to make the pieces slide on easier which made the installation a breeze.  Two sets of nose pieces are included, one bigger than the other.  The bigger nose pieces made my Oakleys fit better on my small face/nose.  Very happy with the purchase!', 3590: \"Would buy these lenses 10 more times if I had to. They fit perfectly unlike some of the other reviews I saw for them. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to have to pay $70 for replacement lenses. The shipping was very fast and I am 100% satisfied!\", 3591: 'After extensive exposure to sunlight, sweat, and heat, during long hours in the saddle, the rubber parts of my Oakley Half Jackets degraded considerably, and needed to be replaced.  I carefully removed sweat by rinsing them with a bit of dish washing liquid, and enough water, and set them to dry spontaneously after every workout in which they saw action.During winters, I would store them after applying some powder talc to the rubber pieces, to try to keep the rubber fresh and supple until I would use them again the following spring.  Despite all the TLC, I had to replace the rubber legs and nose parts.I would recommend applying some Isopropyl Alcohol individually to the Half Jacket frame parts where the pieces need to be installed.  The alcohol completely reduces the friction between the frame, and rubber, and allows for easy installation of the rubber parts.  Alcohol evaporates quickly, but, it should provide enough time to easily set the rubber piece properly in its place.  Once the alcohol evaporates the rubber piece will be solidly set in place.I gave it 4 stars because these sunglasses are not cheap, and Oakley should come up with better materials for their rubber kits.', 3592: 'Time for new parts, these fit great like usual. Always makes my half jackets look like new again. Good looking.!', 3593: 'Good way to rejuvenate the nasty old rubber parts on your half jackets - glad I got the kit!  I will buy earsock kits more frequently.', 3594: \"My husband loves his Oakley half jackets.  He works outside and wears them all day, every day.  Because of that, the nose pieces and the ear socks wear out within a year or so.  We buy the kits and, because they're made by Oakley, they fit perfectly and make the glasses like new again.\", 3595: \"Used one nose piece and it fit as expected.  I'm not certain about the other pieces.  Will update the review if I use the other pieces later.\", 3596: 'I wont say I love it, but shipping was fast price was good, and I needed new pieces. Mine denigrated. Also I was able to change the look. So like having a new pair of glasses', 3597: 'great items', 3598: \"I just needed to replace the nosepiece of my Oakley's and this fit the bill.

A spot of rubbing alcohol under the rubber piece makes them slide on MUCH easier!!', 3603: 'Very good', 3604: 'The brown color was ready un noticeable when installed agains black frame. Needs some grease to install otherwise yoiu might break the frame.', 3605: \"Not that I was really expecting anything other than what was in the package.  These are exactly the same things that were on my glasses, except one set of nose pads are a little bit bigger. The only reason why it isn't five stars is because of the extremely high price on just a few pieces of rubber.  I know you are paying for band name from oakley, but sheesh these are expensive.\", 3606: 'Fits perfect, good material, very satisfied with the product i will recommended to all of my friends and not so friends.', 3607: 'The kit is exactly what I needed after loosing one of the nose pieces for my oakly half jacket frames.

I mean we are only talking about 8 tiny pieces of rubber here...', 3611: 'I ordered this kit because I had lost one of the nosepieces for my Oakley Half jacket sunglasses. You cant go to a brick and mortar store and buy the kit so I ordered it online. They arrived in a timely fashion and that evening I had replaced all of the rubberized pieces to my sunglasses. My only complaint would be that there are no instructions included on the preferred method for removing the old or installing the new. A quick Google search provided me with what I needed and the rest is history.', 3612: 'Love this... was very easy to replace the parts on the glasses comes with 2 different types of nose pieces so you can select your own fit, or change them to fit different situations. Arrived early. Will buy again.', 3613: \"I've had my Oakley's for years now and most of if not all of the plastic pieces were gone.

A little difficult to install but not too bad if you wet them down a little.', 3619: 'My previous set was white and after a year of daily usage was stained and starting to loose it shape and grip.

Easy to install and just a quick fix. Perfect!', 3622: \"I only needed new nose pads, because mine have fallen off TWICE now.This time I used super glue to hopefully avoid the same problem.I replaced the earsocks and corner pieces as well, but had to use WD-40 to slide them on, a very tight fit, but, that's best, so they don't slide around or slip off.\", 3623: 'good fit, finish and they stay put, what else could you want? Easy enough to put on with the help of a drop or two of water.', 3624: 'The fit was spot on. I had a time getting it on but with a little gun oil, it slid right in place.

Nothing was worse than the worn originals coming off all the time. Since I've put them on they haven't come off at all and are doing their job nicely. A couple little things though. First off, They aren't exactly the same as what originally comes with the sunglasses. They are slightly bigger so they don't exactly streamline with the shades like the original. Not really a big deal though. The packaging left a little to be desired also. These obviously aren't going to break as they are rubber but nobody likes to get a flattened box in the mail. Again not a huge deal though. Lastly, pay attention that you are ordering the right color. Somewhere along the line I ordered the root beer color rather than the black I actually wanted. Again, not a big deal because they look ok but was a little disappointed in myself for not thoroughly reviewing my order.\", 3629: 'The rubber nose and head pieces started to get sticky on my Half Jackets.  Ordered these and they are exact replacements for the originals.  Note that the &#34;Made in USA&#34; is the left head piece and &#34;CE&#34; is the right.  Otherwise, match the pieces to the correct sides.Bonus is there are 2 nose piece sizes included.', 3630: 'Fit very well. Hard to get on at first but with a little gun oil the sides slip on easily. Look great too', 3631: \"A quality pair of sunglasses means higher expense and the rubber parts on Oakley's aren't meant for longevity I guess.  This is a very nice and inexpensive option for renewing their fit and finish and not spending $200+ on a new pair.\", 3632: 'Very good, I did order wrong model instead of Flak Jacket I order Half Jacket.  Anyway, the nosepiece that all I need fit my glasses. I used it all. Thank you very much for your product.', 3633: 'Requires some patience and effort to get on, but looks and works like brand new.

We went to a couple of Sunglasses Huts and they didn't any replacements, nor did The Oakley store! I was very thankful to find these online.They fit fine. I did put a little soap and some water on the socks before putting them on, that seemed to help quite a bit.\", 3637: \"I love my half jackets. I somehow managed to lose a nose pad and found only this offering as a replacement. I'm glad I bought it, but I wish I could find just the nose pads (the small ones...).\", 3638: \"These fit my Half Jackets perfectly.  The long ear pieces are kinda tough to get on, but I used a little vaseline and it helped. Just have to work them real slow or you risk snapping your frames. It's also easier if you remove the earpiece from the front frame at the joint (where the screw would be if it had screws). I really just got these for the nose pieces, but it's nice having all new rubber pieces on there.\", 3639: 'saved me alot of money to update instead of buying new. Arrived promptly & easy to put together. Looks great.', 3640: 'I tried some cheap replacements before these and the node pieces just kept coming off and they would be lost.

Fits like a brand new pair of glasses', 3642: \"It fits correctly, it is a genuine Oakley product and it comes with a couple of sets of nose pieces. Whe you purchase the glasses originally, you don't have any choices for nose pieces to keep the glasses off of your cheek bones. With this replacement kit, you do have the option.\", 3643: \"I have a parrot that loves to chew on rubber.  I left my Oakley's on the counter, the bird flew over and before I saw what he was doing, all the rubber pieces were chewed off the glasses into bits.  I've been suffering wearing my glasses without the cushioning of the rubber for much too long, ending up with impressions on my nose and cheeks from the pointy nose plastic and lenses.  Also, without the earsocks, every time I remove the glasses my hair is pulled from my ponytail, making me look/feel messy.  I received my  1/2 Jacket earsock and nosepad kit and suffer no more.  Initially when trying to get the earsock on it was so tight, I thought, there is no way this is going to fit.  Then I applied a dot of dish detergent to the area that the rubber wasn't able to move past and it slid on like a breeze.  Now my Oakley's feel and look fabulous again!!!  :)\", 3644: 'Was very please that they fit perfectly, for the price, it was a great deal.  It actually matched the U.S. Standard cost for military discount.', 3645: \"Good product with great fit.These are the manufacture's parts.I used hand soap with a little water to get the old off,then washed thoroughly.While wet I push on the new.A tight push while twisting back and forth.Worked like a champ.Great seller keep up the good products.THANK YOU.\", 3646: 'Good purchase.....make sure to use hand sanitizer to install or it is a pain.  Good way to freshen up old shades!', 3647: \"Maybe you should not be writing product reviews for others to consider??? As a loyal and true Oakley owner (12+ years) I can only state what I know to be &#34;FACTS&#34;, that can and should be verified with Oakley, before making a comment.  In this case let's consider the product you are considering... They are not just &#34;8 tiny pieces of rubber&#34;, each piece of the earsock and nose pieces are not rubber they are Unobtainium, a proprietary Oakley synthetic that maximizes comfort while increasing grip with perspiration. They are made to fit tightly to the Half Jacket frame which gives them the superior hold Oakleys are known for having... let's face it if Oakleys lost their shape and fell off everytime you looked down, looked up or moved your head in the slightest we would not love them so much!. It has been my experience most improper fittings are due to mistaking the Half and Flak Jacket frames, althought simular they are not interchangeable (and you'll have extra pieces). That being said, I agree the replacement pieces can be a pain to put on; but after a few wears you can tweek the pieces into a more comfortable alignment. Finally... Pricing is the exact same as Oakley.com, so you can feel assured this item (by Amazon sellers) is not over priced.Oakley has now updated the Half Jackets to the HJ 2.0, so if you are like me and cherish your beloved HJ's you may want to stock up on a few replacement socks while the getting is good :} Good Luck and thank you for taking time to read my product review.\", 3648: \"These were a perfect replacement for my Oakley's.

I didn't have much of a problem putting them on.  One thing I noticed is that they have two pairs of nosepiece looks like one is bigger than the 2nd pair.

The translucent frame does do one nice thing though - it almost looks like it\\'s frameless when you\\'re wearing it.

I thought this would be an issue, but after spending 3 weeks in Italy on the beach, i can say it never came up.Other cool feature on these glasses is the placement and type of rubber guards, I shave my head so when i sweat i dont have anything to absorb it.  These rubber pads apparently get sticky when wet.... and they DO!  I bought a cheap pair to wear while in the sea water and those glasses could fall off if i moved my head too fast when wet.Plastic frame but i've never had an issue with the quality plastic Oakley uses.one Stupid thing i would point out, Oakley does not allow you to custom order these with the solid black frames..

They wrap around your eyes to keep side light out and curve perfectly behind your ears. They look so stylish on, I'm always getting compliments on them. They come with a super nice case too. Very good lenses to look through as well.\", 3711: 'As usual, a great pair of sunglasses!  Just hate getting ripped off though by the high prices from the big name brands.  Love to have glass lenses to reduce the scratch potential, but hey, if we keep buying them after we scratch the old pair, why change?', 3712: \"Bought these after trying on a pair that a co worker had just purchased. Optical clarity is AMAZING and blows away my Native shades. They hold up great, don't scratch easily and are nice enough to be worn in a semi professional environment. Also, with Amazon and their free shipping, I paid almost $60 less for my brand new pair than my coworker. Thought that was pretty cool. Two thumbs up and 5 Stars!\", 3713: \"I thought they were great after getting them resized at a sunglasses hut. They go with anything. the way the lenses are made do make a huge difference. deffinitely worht the money to get the polarized ones if you can afford it, i haven't had any real problems with the polarized in these sunglasses, which is a major difference from the cheap walmart brands i used ot buy all the time.\", 3714: 'Happy, the quality is good and the price is reasonable color as I had expected lens was polrized as well', 3715: \"Sunglasses have to be polarized otherwise what's the point? These are light, comfortable, effective. The only negative is that they don't come with a hard case - the soft cover case is rubbish - so you'll need to buy one in order to protect these while they are not on your face. Otherwise they are marvelous.\", 3716: \"The Oakley men's Fuel Cell Polarized sunglasses are very comfortable and work great against the sun.

Perfect fit and the black color really look awesome on him. The only reason why I only gave 4 stars is because when I got the product, there's a little bit of melted part on the side, but other than that, the product is great. I will highly recommend this to my friends.\", 3730: \"Went back to Oakley after having Ray-Bans for years and I'm very glad I did. Love these sunglasses.

They have high quality and clarity.  Not only do I have sunglasses from Oakley, but snowboarding googles too.  It is mainstream wear, but hey, its mainstream for a reason.  Q-U-A-L-I-T-YWas cheapest to buy from Amazon.  Also came with \"prime\" so I saved over 50 bucks, got faster shipping than Oakley itself.  I even gave Oakley a head start.

He loved them and wears them everyday mowing lawns.', 3741: 'First real sunglasses I ever bought and I love them', 3742: 'I had these glasses for a while(opted shortly afterwards for the Ducati version) and they are awesome. Being the first polarized set of glasses I have ever owned, I was not sure whether the view itself would be polarizing (pun intended), having heard ambivalent reviews from various sources as well as justification on the added cost of polarized versions. However, I am glad to say that they have been anything but, and they have been extremely comfortable particularly when driving for long hours, something that cannot be said of  the pair they were replacing, Oakley Gascans.In addition, I have a somewhat wide face and Gascans were simply not working for me, often sliding down the bridge of my nose, so it was refreshing that the fit on these was just optimal.One thing of note is that the Fuel Cells have somewhat large lenses, something that is not obvious in the pics. They are definitely wider (taller?) than the Gascans but not so much that the size stands out.', 3743: 'I bought this for my boyfriend. And wow. He looks so good in it :) He usually buys those cheapie 10 dollar glasses and so this was such a big difference for him in terms of blocking out the sun', 3744: 'Great  sunglasses been debating on buying the fuel cell and now that I have received them I really am glad i did.', 3745: 'I bought these for $110 at my local sunglasses place and they fit and look great , this is my first oakleys .', 3746: 'I recently ordered these for my boyfriend in the matte black with the grey polarized lenses and I love them! They are so sleek with the matte black and the ploarized is cool even though i cant really see a difference , but he can and he loves them. The only problem he had with them was that he said they felt a little tight at first but now they feel fine.', 3747: \"I purchased these after debating if it was worth it to shell out the money for expensive Oakley's about 6 months ago.  I'm happy to report that the glasses are well worth it.  I have the matte black with the polarized lenses.  Absolutely spend the extra couple bucks and get the polarized lenses, so worth it.  The lenses are crystal clear and my vision is improved while wearing the glasses.They are actually quite durable.  Mine fell out of a golf cart and were run over.  The sides separated from the main body but nothing broke and I was thankfully able to put them back together without any issue.  I purchased a hard shell case to keep them in for safe keeping.I love my Fuel Cell's.  They are great looking and durable.  I prefer these to the Gascan's after trying both on at the mall.  The Fuel Cell's are sleeker and can be worn in just about any situation.  They look great with a backwards 59/50 or with a suit.\", 3748: 'Wow so let me first start off by saying that I had these glasses on my wish list in amazon forever and just never could justify spending the money on them now that I have kids (having another pair in white doesnt hurt either). I used to have a black pair and lost them and so needed another black to replace them since the white ones dont match with everything. Anyways they were sitting in my wishlist and I just happened to be scrolling through it when i saw the price of the glasses were 11 dollars! No joke you read that right, eleven dollars lol. I was confused at first that maybe they were just lenses or a bag or something dumb but sure enough when i clicked it and it took me to the item page they were 11 bucks. I quickly jumped on it and ordered a pair...I wanted to order 2 pairs since they had 2 in stock but i didnt want to get greedy as I would have just sold them. Anyways kudos to the seller, Campmor, for honering their mistake. As soon as i ordered I went back and they had changed the price back to 100 bucks. I think maybe someone over there messed up lol. What luck!So getting over my happiness...the product itself is great. As stated I did own a black pair before which I lost and so I was stuck with only one white pair forever. My white ones (same fuel cell) have lasted me easily 3 years and they still look very good. I do not get the impression they feel cheap at all. They are light and snap apart which is what they are supposed to do in case you sit on them. They looks good...a little on the big side as far as glasses go but you can tell from the pics they are small glasses. This is the style i was looking for anyways. I ride a motorcycle and they fit inside my helmet so they arent that huge. All in all great glasses. So happy to finally have another black pair.', 3749: 'LAST NASCAR RACE WAS EVEN BETTER. THESE GLASSES WERE JUST WHAT WAS NEEDED. I COULD FINALLY SEEEVERY DETAIL, ON AND OFF THE TRACK.  IN TRAFFIC DRIVING NORTH TO THE RACE, THEY EASED THETRIP, DELETING THE USUAL STRESS OF HIGHWAY DRIVING. IT,S NICE TO KNOW WHATS AHEAD IN HEAVY TRAFFIC.CHECK THEM OUT! IF YOU DON.T LIKE THEM, THE REFUND POLICY AT AMAZON IS THE BEST!!', 3750: 'these sunglasses are exactly as advertised. my second pair of oakleys. my first pair was the fast jackets which I absolutely love.  these fuel cells seemed a little big on my face at first but I have grown to like them more and more. if you can afford it get them in polarized.', 3751: 'Got these as a birthday gift for my husband and he loves them!  Flat black color and polarized lenses are amazing; great quality!', 3752: \"I must say these glasses are great! I really like the look and feel of them. The polarized lens is amazing. I like to fish and go golfing and I have to say they are amazing at reducing the glare from the sun. You can really notice this while fishing. The glare is greatly reduced coming off the water and you can see so clearly into the water. You will be able to see things you normally wouldn't be able too with a normal pair of lens. The only really I gave them four stars is because after prolonged wearing they hurt the tops of my ears pretty bad. I know a few other guys have had this problem before also. And I am talking about after wearing them for about six hours straight so it's not something that happens often. I would highly recommend this glasses.\", 3753: 'First of all the price can\\'t be beat! The Matte Black looks great and the style is perfect for people with \"bigger\" faces. Shipping was super fast as always. The polarized lenses are amazing and everything is very clear and vivid.

You won\\'t be disappointed!', 3754: \"Originally I was leaning torward the Hi Jinx model but when i went to try them on at the store in the mall the shape was a little too big for my face. I previously had the gascans and i wanted something with a bigger lens so the fuel cells were just right. I'd say the size is right between the gascans and the hi jinx. They're super light and comfy on your face. I was already familiar with oakley's polarized lenses and knew that my next pair would have to be polarized. The lenses do some strange things to outside colors but things are definately clearer, sharper or what oakley refers to as in HD. I actually like the change in colors because it kinda reminds me that the lenses are working. I definately love these glasses. I scooped these up for $35 because I had redeemed some amazon points.\", 3755: 'I got exactly what I expected and LOVE them.  These do not appear to be seconds or returns.  The discount was good.

Just make sure you get a good price on them and if you\\'re in the military get them off that other website I mentioned.5 stars!', 3757: 'Oakley always deliver. These are not only comfortable but helps to keep sunlight away cause they are big and protective.', 3758: \"These glasses are exceptionally good. I live in Florida, and i wear these glasses religiously whenever I am outdoors, including driving. They have excellent glare protection, are superbly comfortable, and I look great wearing them! I have been wearing Oakley glasses for the last 29 years (I was way ahead of the sheep - I still have the ORIGINAL Frogskins!) The glasses are easy to clean, and if you are careful with them, they can outlast most marriages. The bag is essential in keeping the glasses scratch free - if you are not wearing them, place the glasses in the bag.I have used my glasses in the ocean, while fishing; in the water and on the beach; while shopping with my wife (incognito); and walking my dogs every morning. No squinting, no glare, no soreness in the eyes, and no headache. The $150+ price point scares most wannabee's, but rookies are not invited.This is my second pair in 4 years - my drunk friend stole my first pair. Protect your eyes - wear Oakleys.\", 3759: 'Not too big and not too small. Oakley optics. The styling is the best in the Oakley line, in my opinion.

Well made and Oakely Quality!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy this pair if you need sunglasses!', 3761: \"1st off let me start by stating , i'm no fan boy of Oakley's , i either love them or hate them ...I bought these glasses at a fair price S&H; included here on Amazon . I was in the market for a black pair to replace an older and somewhat worn pair of black Oakley's i already owned for sometime . I saw these in a few local shops but  was not happy with the pricing and customer service , so , off to the WWW i went . I knew they would fit my rather larger than average head and provide the eye coverage i expected . I also knew they were available with polarized lenses which i'm a nut for . Granted most local shops could probably have ordered them custom for me but why do that and pay more when i could handle it all right here and get exactly what i wanted , cheaper and faster ? SO i did ...The invoice stated it would be between 12 and 17 days for delivery and man was i anxious . Surprisingly though they arrived early :) After only 9 days from the date of order i had my new Fuel Cells in matte black with black chrome logo's , grey tinted polarized lenses ( they matched the black chrome logo's ) and brand spanking new right out the package . EXCELLENT !Right off the bat though i did notice 1 small issue , granted it's completely harmless and seriously not a big deal but when i ordered them it gave me an option to select what style lil' sock i wanted which was not what was included in my shipment . Instead i received the standard plain jane rootbeer colored baggy / O sock as they call it . But i'm not one to fuss over spilled milk or trivial things .These glasses are very very similar to the Gascan's if your familiar with those frames . The only differences are the arms have a seperate lil' groove in them and are just a lil' bit thicker . Also on this frame the lenses are a tiny bit larger than on my Gascan's and sit a lil' higher on the bridge of your nose . But aside from those minor details they look nearly identical .I mentioned above i owned a pair of Gascan's , the frames by which all others are now judged when it comes to fit finish performance and everything else in my book . I truly love those glasses ! These are 99% as good as those are . My only real complaint about these glass's or specifically the frames is that with them sitting slightly higher on the bridge of my nose and having these slightly larger lenses they tend to bump my brow and sit so close to my eyes that occasionally i can feel my lashes hit the lenses . I've discussed this with a couple friends and other owners and they seem to have similar comments / thoughts / issues / whatever you wanna lable it as . However , not 1 of those people that i've spoke with , including myself would give them up , send em' back or trade out of them . So this testifies , atleast in my case as to how otherwise perfect , comfortable and satisfying they truly are .If your shopping O's then take a good hard serious look at these , they're exceptional shades an available here at Amazon for pretty good deals too ;)\", 3762: \"First pair of Oakley's I have ever owned and I am sorry I waited so long. I do a lot of driving and also out on the water boating. The Fuel Cells have eliminated the glare and make it so much easier on the eyes. No more squinting and you are not worn out from staring in the sun on a bright day. It doesn't hurt that they look good as well. Highly recommend to anyone that is out in it everyday.\", 3763: \"Just to start, I am a man that has a big head.  I have to buy the L/XL hats that are fitted and even have to stretch them a bit.  These sunglasses fit like a glove.  They aren't to tight and I've jogged in them, they aren't going anywhere.  I was at first nervous about being able to fit my hat on also while wearing these, but I had no problem.  They really fill your entire vision and the clarity is pretty awesome.This is my first pair of Oakley sunglasses, so i'm pretty impressed.  I was disappointed they came with a soft pouch.  I was expecting a hard shell case, but I will just have to buy one on here for $5 bucks or so.  Not going to pay $30 for a sunglass case.Great sunglasses, I highly recommend.\", 3764: 'Husband loves them! Bought for a gift.  He had the older version and really liked the matte finish.

My son wanted these and I looked online on Oakley and Sunglass Hut and they were $160.00....uggghhh. It was going to be a Christmas present so I was willing to pay that. Then I thought...let me check Amazon. I got it for $110.00....yaaahhhhhh!! I received it in a couple of days and love them!!!!! Lucky for me that I ordered on that day because the price went up to 125.00 the next day, which is still a great price!', 3769: 'I love them...For its price this is Great choice belive me...Stylish and not ordinary sunglases :-)It could be better to get them with case,but...Any case they look great for me :-)', 3770: 'comfortable fit.  seem stylish and not much glare compared with others,  seems similar to my experience with other Oakleys.  I would usually buy this brand and I am not disappointed', 3771: \"Love how these sunglasses wrap around the sides so you don't get reflections on the inside of the glass from light sources behind you. Matt black frame looks good, but if you have oily fingers it leaves fingerprints on the surface of the frame.The polarisation on all oakley glasses create a lot of artifacts and I personnaly don't like it much because of that, but I love the color of the lenses and how much more contrast it gives.\", 3772: 'These are really great shades. I am over 50 and I wear contacts. The color of the lens takes out all the glare and I am able to go about my day without difficulty.', 3773: 'Great product!  Arrived on time, durable sunglasses.

Like them for golf because they do not slide off your face on warm days', 3774: 'I have always loved Oakley sunglasses and have worn them for 10 years.  My primary pair for the last 4 years has been a pair of black/grey Half Jacket XLJs.  I ordered these red Flak Jacket XLJs because I liked the frame color and the overall design is similar to the Half Jacket.  There is no Oakley store near my home so I did not have a chance to see the glasses before I ordered them.  I got two surprises when my order arrived from Extreme-O.  First of all, the \"VR28 Black Iridium\" lenses are actually a reddish brown color.  I had thought they would be black, as the name implies.  My second surprise was that the glasses arrived packed in a Flak Jacket XLJ soft vault case.  The case alone is sold for $30.I am not sold on the lens color, yet.  They make the world look a little rosy.  However, I can\\'t argue with getting the glasses and case for $108 (plus $5 shipping).  All and all I feel as if I got my money\\'s worth.  I would have given these glasses a 5 star rating had the lenses been darker.  In the end, I\\'ll likely get used to the color of the lenses.', 3775: \"I rated this product as 5 stars due to the fact that these are the exact same polarized lenses I wanted to replace. I read a review here that stated these were not Oakley lenses because they did not have &#34;Polarized&#34; etched in both lenses. My original Monster Dogs only had it etched on the lower portion of the left lens. These replacements are identical to my originals. The clarity of these replacements is crystal clear edge to edge. No distortions. My originals served me very well, but were scratched over 6 years of daily use and the occasional accidental drop. These replacements arrived safely in an Oakley Manufacturer's box. Amazon shipped this in a larger box so item arrived in mint condition. The lenses are a breeze to change out. Just follow the included instructions and you should have a new pair of sunglasses in short order. Wish I would have considered this upgrade sooner!\", 3776: 'I was lucky to get these lenses at this price. Great buy! This would have easily costed by more than 85$ if I had gotten from Oakley directly!', 3777: \"It's not necessary talk about quality: they're just like the assembled original lenses.But they should cost less then almost 60% of a MonsterDog pair of sunglasses...Very easy to exchange the lenses.\", 3778: 'In past, I would visit a Oakley Store and have them replace my lenses. Luckily, this trip I was told they were a discontinued model and not in stock. Surprisingly the store manager mentioned checking online.........so where else would I go other than Amazon.

Took note of all the reviews and purchased. I carefully inspected the old lenses which popped out as per provided instructions (utube has a couple videos also). Checked all the markings noting left lens had the information on the bottom edge of the lens. Took the newly acquired lenses out and observed the exact marking on the left lens.I wore them around sunny California today and the glasses are just as good as new. I own two sets of Monster Dogs so I will be purchasing a second set of lenses for future use.I would recommend. My main concern was having the correct lenses for the glasses. More costly but I prefer the full protection the original lenses afforded me.', 3781: 'These were a great buy!

I ordered these and they snapped right in, are crystal clear, and keep glare to a minimum. Another great thing about them is that they're very neutral shaded, so you're not going to be confusing any colors through them.The only problem with polarized lenses is that sometimes they'll cut off visibility of electronic devices unless you rotate them.  But that's a small price to pay to have all that glare cut out.I'm very pleased with them!\", 3794: 'as always Oakley is a great product. they fit well easy to install as with all Oakley products a little pricey but in the end you get what you pay for', 3795: 'My husband had scratched his other oaskley lenses up bad and I am so glad I found these lenses instead of buying him a whole new pair of sunglasses.

Within minutes i had them switched out, cleaned and on my face. Amazing.One thing i was confused about was that everywhere else you buy them they come in a nice plush case.

As the other reviewer said, with some electronic screens the brightness will be lowered depending on how you tilt your head. It's not a big deal though, I don't even notice a difference anymore.Only downside to these are that Oakley charges so much. For a couple pieces of plastic I would think they would be much cheaper.\", 3802: 'I really like the Iridium lenses! My dog got a hold of my Oakley Gascans and chewed the edge of the lenses and frame in a couple of spots. I thought about buying new glasses, but I really like the Gascans and thought I would just try new lenses. These are expensive, but I basically have a new pair of glasses for about half the price. I have heard that this type of lens scratches easily. I keep them in the original Oakley bag that came with my glasses originally. This reside in a pocket in my computer bag along with a couple of other items. I have used them for about 6 months this way with no issue.', 3803: 'I change my lenses because the last ones had to many scratches.The polarized id great, supper easy to fit and truly protect you from the sun.Get this one instead of the generic ones!', 3804: 'The lenses were an exact match to the original scratched ones. Very easy to intall using the provided instructions, was done in less than five minutes. A good deal at half the price of new glasses. Will definitely buy more when needed.', 3805: 'These were just as described, OEM Oakley replacement lenses.  You never notice how scratched up your old ones are until you pop in a new pair....', 3806: \"They are clear lenses but 85 for the polarized is a little pricey. I almost went with the non-polarized but I'm glad I didn't.\", 3807: \"These are great. I've had them for quite a while now and they have held up very well with no scratches. They are definitely polarized and appear to be exact matches to the original Oakley factory lenses. Easy to pop in and replace as well. I definitely recommend and would purchase again.\", 3808: 'I love it!', 3809: 'Needed some new lenses for my 2 year old Gascans that have been everywhere with me. Leave it to Oakley to provide a dozen choices. I could have changed up my sunglasses so many different ways. The Iridium coated polarized lenses are great for driving in bright sun. Eliminates dashboard reflections and provides super clear visibility.', 3810: \"Perhaps my memory of Oakley Iridium lenses is a bit warped from years of keggers and power hours but they seem to be far more reflective than they used to be.  Sure this is great if you're a cop, lifeguard, top gun, X-Men or some other individual who's all out of bubble gum, but for John or Jane Q. Public it's hard not to feel like you have a solar oven strapped to your eyes.That said, these fit perfectly in the frames and were a literal snap to install.  The polarization is heavenly on days following a snowstorm, preventing me from taking out a family of four on their way home from little Susie's dance recital.  What can I say?  These lenses save lives.Final score: Four out of five.\", 3811: 'Better than paying for it on Oakley.com. Amazon is amazon. GREAT.If you want to replace your lenses with polarized lenses I highly recommend these. The color is great and keeps the reflection off objects and water bearable, which is important to me spending a lot of time at ski resorts in the winter and on the water fishing in the summer.Get polarized. Protect your eyes!!', 3812: 'Function as they should, look amazing, appear to be relatively tough, and did I mention they look freaking awesome??? Fit my frames perfectly. would buy another pair.', 3813: \"Amazon made it easy for me to replace the gnarly scratched up lenses from my Oakley Gascan frames.  The product shipped in a foam-wrapped package which was snugly packaged inside an Oakley box.  No scratches or defects were noted.  It also came with easy to follow instructions in case you're a newbie to lens replacement.\", 3814: \"My old Gascan lenses had been around the world and stuffed in all sorts of unforgiving places so it was time for replacement. It's now a whole new world obviously. My only quibble is the price of the new ones. Pretty ridiculous. Also, inserting them into the frames is a bit tricky. Be sure and follow the directions that come with the new ones.\", 3815: \"My husband loves this style and when his original lenses finally gave out these worked great.  You can't buy these any more so it was really nice to be able to find replacement lenses.\", 3816: \"I rated this five stars for now because I'm going to wait a little while to see how the lenses actually hold up. They did come in an Oakley box and fit just right. They weren't polarized just the like description said so, so far, so good. If they're sturdy I'll give 5 stars without a doubt!\", 3817: 'I purchased these not knowing if they were actually Oakley quality since the frames are no longer made. They arrived on time and proved a perfect replacement. With a little patience, they installed in minutes. Perfect fit for the frames. Outstanding product.', 3818: 'The fit was great, and they arrived right away.  However, my husband noted that they almost looked mirrored as opposed to a flat matte, which is what he needed for work.  He was so happy just to have new lenses without scratches in them, he kept them.  Would purchase again.', 3819: \"This is the 2nd time I have purchased from this seller and this style, good quality, it has allowed me to keep my Oakley glasses looking new for much longer (saves money since I don't have to purchase a new pair of Oakley sunglasses each time I scratch my pair).\", 3820: 'Good. Only negative is they are not polarized lenses like original pair. Still had original box and entered information so I expected the replacements to be polarized,especially for the price.', 3821: 'My wife has been using her Oakley Minute 2.0 for over 5 years and there are so many scratches and abuse to the lens. Oakley are selling the Polarize lens for $95 and Amazon is selling for $49. It is so much cheaper here and these are good quality lens. It came with instruction on how to remove the lens and installing the new one. It took me less than 5 minutes to replace the old lens. I might get extra lens before they are sold out since the frame is no longer available for sale.', 3822: 'These are great replacements for the Oakley Oil Rig sunglasses. They are exact fit replacements and the vision clarity is good.

The lens fits perfectly.  What it doesn't show in the photos is that the lens is nearly a mirror finish (in silver).  It doesn't bother me at all, I think they look pretty sharp, but you may want to take that into consideration before you order them.Also, they are supposed to come with a case (a soft carrying cloth/bag I believe).  MINE DID NOT COME WITH THAT CASE...unless they were referring to the thin cardboard box they came in? So I take away 1 star for that.  4/5\", 3831: 'Great product!

These replace a pair of VR28 Black Iridium that were all scratched up.

Look forward to getting these fit into my frames.\", 3836: \"Great product. I was excited to see they were available as I dropped my glasses and they were hacked up.

I was looking for Genuine Oakley replacements and not the aftermarket items that came up as part of my search.  I was nervous they may not fit since they have &#34;rimless&#34; in all the descriptions, but Amazon's no hassle return policy on this product made me take the chance.Well I am writing this review to let you know they were in fact a perfect fit for my Oakley straight Jackets (2nd generation per another Amazon product listing).  These came packaged well in original Oakley packaging and instructions.  Flawless delivery and instructions.

After searching the Oakley sight using the model number on the arm of his sun-glasses it was super easy to order replacements from Amazon, and the lenses popped right in and fit great.  My husband was super excited and is using the nice carry pouch to protect them from getting so beat up in the future.

Not only do i like the look of the antix, but i like the easy change lens. the lens fits perfectly. an added bonus, they come in the oakley sunglasses wipe cloth/bag that my original oakleys came in that i lost in afghanistan. the lens was a perfect match for what the color described, its important to note the lenses are not polarized if thats what you are looking for.

Glad you sell these lenses!!!!They are perfect!\", 3856: 'I just moved back to the southwest and needed polarized lenses. I already had the straight jacket, which I like. So instead of nearly $200 for a complete new set I ordered these. They installed very easily an do the job well!', 3857: \"The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because it has the word &#34;POLARIZED&#34; etched into the bottom left corner of the left lens.  I see that text in the corner of my eye and it is distracting and looks like there is a smudge on my lenses.  I don't see the point in having this text there, so it does nothing but detract from an otherwise great product.Another note, if you aren't familiar with the effects that polarized lenses can have, make sure you read up on this before jumping in.  They are great at reducing glare, but you will also see odd patterns and color effects that you won't see with non-polarized lenses.  For example, when driving a car, you will see checker patterns in the windows of other cars (especially rear windows) because that glass is polarized as well.  You will also see strange color shimmers in places like some of the displays inside of your car (my AC temp readout has a purple-ish hue to it when I wear them) or when looking at your smart phone, etc.  Just make sure you know about this and are ok with it, otherwise stick with non-polarized lenses (personally, I don't think polarized lenses are worth the extra $$ and won't buy them again, but I wanted to try them out).As for what these are supposed to be, they are great.  They fit in easily, they are great quality, and they are crystal clear and reduce glare.\", 3858: 'These are genuine Oakley not fake. Better price too. Easy replace yourself.

Highly recommend and the price isn't to bad either\", 3872: 'These are a greta pair of replacement lenses from the oakley store themselves They fit my oil rigs just perfect.', 3873: \"The description does not mention that the lens is Iridium coated. I checked Oakley's website to verify the sku # and was pleasantly surprised to see once my package arrived that it is indeed Iridium coated.

I love and collect sunglasses so I have built quite a collection of Oakley, Ray-Ban, Maui Jim, Nike, Serengetti, Kirkland, Hobie, and Puma sunglasses. These are my favorite sunglasses. As with most Oakley sunglasses, the quality and clarity of the lense is truly superior. Even though these are metal frames, they are exceptioanlly well balanced and comfortable due I am sure to the type of metal used. I did have to switch to the smaller nose pieces but they fit comfortably. The bend on the ear stems removes pressure from my temples that often lead to headaches when I wear sunglasses for a long time. The ear stem also blends in perfectly with my head size and shape. The earpieces on my Oakley Straight Jackets pertruded out too far over my cranium.Althought these sunglasses are not cheap by any means, you will almost always get a better deal on Amazon.com. Just watch out and don't buy from third party vendors as you may not get the same deal. I wound up buying these for $250 instead of the mall price of $400. I sold some of my sunglasses on line in order to pay for these.I would also like to thank Amazon.com for their exceptional customer service and return policy. I actually got these sunglasses before but was sent a box that seemed as though it had been opened already and the metal frames/ear stems were not sitting flat. I am a Prime Member and quite frankly do most of my shopping for just about everything at Amazon.com.\", 3883: \"These are made of metal, but are still surprisingly light. They stay in place, even while running which is the main reason I use them. They filter the sun well without any distortion and do not fog easily.

I always lean towards buying Oakleys and these did not disappoint.  They are very stylish and have excellent polarization.  Color is very nice and very happy all around.', 3885: \"I've always been an Oakley eye wear fan and bought a couple of older models in the past. This is my first polarized Oakley though so it's pretty cool. I only wished Oakley has the Ice Iridium model for metal frame models.\", 3886: 'Great pair of sunglassed .Very light and they polerized also.I have a slender face and have a hard time finding a pair that fit .The lens color are perfect for driving even on cloudy days', 3887: 'Seem to be well made.

I have an Oakley Penny with VR28 black iridium lens which is comparatively much smaller than the X-Squared. But when my X-Squared arrived I was just blown away by the beautiful colored lens (polarized fire iridium) that screams for attention. And when I tried them on I couldn't believe my eyes -- such clarity and contrast when you look through the lens! Everything looks much better than the naked eye. Also, the bigger lens results in a wider peripheral vision. This model is perfect for driving in the summer as well as in the harsh winter because of the optical clarity it provides. Oakley's High Definition Optics is simply the best, the gold standard of all sunglasses.The Oakley Polarized X-Squared is pricey at $400, but I must say that it is worth every penny. Made of titanium alloy it is sure to last decades. I've had my Oakley Penny for 12 years now and it looks like it's good for another 100,000 miles, so to speak. So this X-Squared is sure to last as long or probably even longer than my Penny now that I will be taking better care of my Oakleys from now on (the X-Metal series are becoming rare and highly collectible).For the looks (and yes, the X-Squared will look good on you), the science behind the Oakleys, and ultimate eye protection (Oakley lenses exceed Anzi standards =  unrivaled impact protection; and 100% UV filtering of the purest lens material on earth)  the Oakley X-Squared is the pair of sunglasses to own and to keep for the rest of your life.\", 3890: 'These are my favorite sunglasses, so it goes without saying that I am happy with my purchase.

It was exactly what I was looking for:Dark lenses. I extremelly recommend those sunglasses! I Hope to keep this one for a long time.', 3898: \"Made in China.  These are fake Oakley sunglasses.  Do not buy these.  If you want knockoffs, there are more economical choices out there.EDIT:Once finding out that Oakley frames are now made in China (years later), I decided to change the rating, as is fair.  They are good glasses.  I lost them for years in a duffle bag and upon finding them, had zero scratches to the lenses.

I have a long, rectangular-shaped face with a strong jawline (just throwing it out there just for those who are wondering about their facial features). The glasses shield me from the sun just enough but what I really love is the brown color on the lenses. When looking through the glasses, everything looks unnatural, but in a good way. Everything has a nice warm color to it when looking through the glasses; the lens color allows your eyes to see extremely comfortably.The downside to these glasses, in my opinion, is the metal frame. I have really sensitive skin so the metal frame weighs down on my face a lot and will sometimes bother my ears and nose. The sensitive skin issue gives the glasses their downfall on my face because the rubber nose pads leave imprints on my nose after wearing them for about 10+ minutes.Basically, if you do not have sensitive skin, buy them. They will look great and you will feel really comfortable,', 3903: 'Glasses are usual Oakley quality. I am overall satisfied.

I have always bought my sunglasses at a big box store & have never spent more than $20 on them.  My husband bought these for me as a gift.Now I know what the fuss is all about!  When I wear cheap glasses I see everything as dark.  The sun is blocked, but only because the lenses are dark.  With these glasses, the sun is blocked but everything is so clear!  I don't even feel like I am looking out through lenses.  Clouds are defined, not blinding in the sunlight.  Everything is so clear!I love the discreet pattern on the inside of these glasses.  The glasses are super neutral, I can wear them with anything.  But the pattern on the inside is fun & funky.  People have commented on them when I take them off.  Fun!\", 3912: 'I bought these back in March (2012), before we went on vacation.

She loves these glasses and might I add looks pretty damn cute in them too!!! She has also had a ton of compliments from other girls liking them!', 3914: 'I love my new sunglasses.  They look and feel great and the color is different than the usual tortoise or black famed glasses.', 3915: \"These sunglasses are great! The fit is great and I've gotten a ton of complements on them! Love that they also came with a case!\", 3916: \"I looove my pair of Oakleys! I bought the purple plaid frame ones and I love their color and shape. Only problem is that they don't fit me 100%, but that's really my fault because I know I have a flat nose. I still wear them, though! They also come in a huuge white box with a protective pouch to make sure they stay in mint condition.\", 3917: 'I have the black/ multi striped and I love them.  They are very comfortable.  Very light and oh so cute.', 3918: \"Oakleys, what more can you say, nice hard case along with microfiber cloth case. Sweet glasses for the wife. She loves them where's the every day\", 3919: \"These sunglasses are beyond FAB! I ordered them after months of contemplating and couldn't be happier with them. They're super stylish, cut down on glare, and fit better than anything I've had before. Plus, they came in WEEKS before they were scheduled to! I LOVE Amazon AND Oakleys :)\", 3920: 'These are some sweet shades, with a unique look. The lens quality is excellent, and depending on the shape of your head, will fit great!Only complaint is that the odd shape of the temples, makes them uncomfortable to wear on top of your head.', 3921: \"I love these sunglasses. It is light and fits comfortably. I love the design and also the stripes on the inside of the glasses. The one thing that is keeping me from giving this product a 5 stars is a small defect. The handles are not evenly curved. One of the handles is not as curvy as the other one causing it to fit unevenly on my face. It is not really noticeable; however I can feel it on my face. One of the lenses would slightly touches my face while the other doesn't. I brought it to a local sunglasses shop and compared it with the ones they have. It turned out that I bought a pair with the minor defect.\", 3922: 'Bought these for my fiance and she loves them.  Looked around forever and she really liked these.  The polarized lenses really cut down on the glare and they are constructed very well.  The price is a little high in my opinion but they are Oakleys.', 3923: 'This sunglasses very good to use,its polarized lens ,very good protect for your eyes,i got the item in 1week after i paid,very fast delivery.', 3924: \"I must admit, I haven't been a big fan of Oakley in the past. But after seeing these on a friend, I fell in love with them right away. And after trying them on, it just solidified my resolve to own a pair. And to top it off, I've gotten more positive comments on this pair than any other that I've owned. If you're looking for a sophisticated, upscale look, these are unmatched.\", 3925: 'I just picked up these glasses today at a local shop in one of the more trendy areas of my town. They had all sorts of glasses, but I went in with a purpose - Oakley Inmates and Probations. I quickly darted to the Oakley section, and much to my chagrin they had both kinds. I tried both on, looked in the mirror for about a minute each and purchased the Probations. They fit amazingly well on my head (which is probably larger than most) and are extremely comfortable. I was worried that they would fog up in the middle, or that the view would be distorted towards the edges because they are one solid piece of glass, but neither of these problems were an issue.I definitely recommend them.', 3926: 'I have been a long time fan of Oakley and buy their glasses often. The Probation glasses are one of the best styles that I have seen in a while. Solid frames and awesome lens design and tint. They will be a great addition to my Oakley collection.', 3927: 'After oing to the beach several times with this pair of oakley and they are still in perfect condition. It fits my head perfectly and the build is very solid. This is my second pair of oakley, first one was gascan S but the probation looks so much better. Tint is perfect for sunny days. No rust even on scratched areas, unlike other \"branded\" sungleasses I\\'ve got.', 3928: 'very nice sunglasses i got these for my wife she loves them and they fit her perfect as most oakleys quality product', 3929: 'So glad I got these for my wife.  They came in a matter of days and look even better in person than in pictures.  Very happy with this purchase.', 3930: \"My wife really love it!!! came in as advertised! it's an oakley and expect it to last!\", 3931: 'Was a gift for my wife and she really love it, the sunglasses besides to be  confortable also are very pretty', 3932: \"I wish the frame was in black color and I would like this more with the red lens. However, the frame's color is still great as an alternative one and I just love the red lens. This is one the great models I have discovered for sunglasses.\", 3933: 'I have several Oakleys and most of them are pricey except for this one. Less $100 and you get a stylish Oakley! I use this almost everyday even when I do may daily run at Redondo beach. Oakley eyewears are really awesome!', 3934: 'I bought these for my son and he loves them.  When they came in the mail, my husband tried them on. Within two days, I was ordering another pair.  They are a bit expensive but the men in my house say they are worth it!', 3935: 'If like me you have a rounder head then these glases are perfect as they manage to block out the annoying side light promenet with other styles of sunglasses. The actual size of the glasses is a nice plus as well(aprox. 2-2.25 inches tall) as they dont look goofy like the \"frog eye\" style glasses. The side \"socks\" can have a bit of a sharp edge(from the manufacturing process) this can be fixed with a dull butter knife though smooths out the ridge sometimes left that can cut ear skin. The glasses stay in place even when sweating hardcore(I run several miles a day). A great set of glasses overall and they look good to boot.', 3936: 'Thank you so much - the product was great - just as expected and we received the product within four day from US to AUST. Thank you so much. I would definitely recommend you to my friends.', 3937: 'Freakin favorite pair of Oakleys ever. Had a pair and lost them then Oakley seemingly discontinued them.

Quick shipping of a brand new product - exactly as I received my first pair from the Oakley website', 3938: 'i bought this sunglasses for the metric century race last march 2012 and i love it. i can highly recommend this product and i have no any problem. it fits perfect to my face and it really protect my eyes from the long ride.', 3939: 'Estos lentes son muy buenos, son de material plastico en color mate.Tienen buen acabado y el modelo es espectacular, 100 % recomendable, me gusta mucho la marca oakley.', 3940: 'Glasses were exactly as described. Fit is really nice. Super lightweight. Love the red iridium lenses and the red O for Oakley sets off a certain style.', 3941: \"This is the second time I have purchased this for my husband as he accidental ran over his first pair. It looks really good with his blond hair and fair complexion, he loves to wear them. I think that the product is a good quality but I would appreciate even better polarization, that's why I am giving it four stars.\", 3942: 'Unfortunately I already lost them but this is the kind of item that makes you loyal to a brand. 100% Recommended.', 3943: \"I like those Oakley for the shape of the frame and mostly for the fire lens. But i'm a little disapointed with the quality, the frame look like a cheap oakley made from Japan or Taiwan, it look fragile and can brake easly.\", 3944: 'Glasses arrived promptly in cloth bag. As advertised, very sharp.They were a gift, and my son loved them. He is a huge Oakley fan.', 3945: 'I love oakleys and these might be my new favorite pair.I love the lenses they make the world seem almost bluer and brighter.', 3946: 'I love the fit, performance and style of these Oakley sunglasses. My vision is very sharp with them, they are comfortable and they stay on. My only quibble is the white color, which is a little bright for my taste. In the picture, they looked a little less bright, but this does not ruin my overall satisfaction.', 3947: 'bought these for using with a non full face motorcycle helmet. Perfect! Lens are clear, protective,and the frame fits my medium face well. They grip well and wind does not try to blow them off. Lens are tough, and so far, after a couple of months of use and abuse, no scratches! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!', 3948: 'My favorite white oakleys so far. Havent seen everyone and their mother sporting them!! Enjoy the fit and the look. Decent price as well!!!', 3949: \"Great sunglasses with nice lens!! Fit almost everybody's face and looks perfect!!!It's a Oakley,do I need to tell more?!\", 3950: 'That is fit on me, i love oakley! The white color is cool and maybe next time i should buy pit bull or monster dog.', 3951: 'These are awesome lightweight offerings from Oakley.  The brown smoke lenses work well in the very bright sunlight of my tropical climate. I thought I would have a hard time switching back from a couple years of polarised lenses, but it was seamless. Because they are so lightweight and spartan, then heat build up behind the shades is also minimised. All around one of the best of a numerous Oaks I have owned.', 3952: '', 3953: \"It's awsome.

I recommend them highly.\", 3955: 'Genuine product. Fast delivery. Well packed. Fits great. I bought it without fit it before and the sunglasses were perfect. Oakley is a very good brand and quality.', 3956: \"When I first tried these on I noticed how the lenses extended below my line of visionso I don't see and light around the frames.  The peripheral vision is excellent.  I've had these for about two months now.  I have used them in what i would consider a normal routine and have had no problems with either the lenses nor the frames themselves.  The frames are rubberized around the nose and ears which makes them very comfortable and extremely secure. One downside I've noticed is that when the glasses sit close to your face they tend to fog up a bit.  Not awful but enough to be annoying. ALl in all I do not regretthis purchase and know I will have these for years.\", 3957: 'Crystal clear view, very light, comfortable wear, cuts the glare tremendously, the nicest pair of Oakleys I own!', 3958: \"These shades have been one of the best Oakleys I have ever owned - and I've owned a few!  They are extremely lightweight and comfortable, especially when wearing them for a long period in a very warm tropical climate. They don't cover enough of the face to make you feel hot, and do not trap sweat.  The lens are as usual, excellent.  Even on the brightest of days, I can count on my shades.\", 3959: 'Fits just about awesome! Oakley - Ducati Casey Stoner edition. Great quality and design  I use them a lot with no complains, and now are a collection item and very valiavle for me.', 3960: 'These glasses are one of my favorites!  I get compliments all the time. Coverage and vision is ideal.  My only wish would be rubberized tips at the end of the earpieces.  That way, if you perspire or have gel in your hair...or both...the glasses would not slide down your nose.', 3961: 'very good product quality, meets all my expectations. Is just what I was looking for, Oakley is the best of the best!', 3962: 'I normally do not purchase expensive sun glasses because I lose them, however since these are TACA, I figured I would support the cause. I had forgotten how nice a good pair of glasses feel. Great glasses, Great cause!', 3963: 'too bad the length of the frames were not exact what i was looking for but the lenses overall are great... great design and feels good.', 3964: \"They're expensive but they're worth every penny. I look forward to putting these on every time especially for driving. The polorizing effect really cuts down on glare from other cars as well as the road. Plus they're stylish. You'll be somebody when you wear these. One piece of advice I can give you is to use the micro-fiber bag to store your glasses in after every time you wear them. I've had a couple pairs of these over the years and didn't use the bag and they ended up being scratched and they just didn't last as long. This last pair still looks brand new after a year of continous use simply by using the storage bag.\", 3965: 'Il prodotto &egrave; arrivato prima della data prefissata, la confezione &egrave; stata di buone dimensioni, ottima la spiegazione del prodotto.', 3966: \"I'm a big fan of Oakley shoes and this one doesn't disapoint.In terms of looks, this is one beautiful pair of shoes. The black color I got looks really classy with the red threadings and also the red part of the soles showing up front.Comfortwise, they're very nice to wear. I didn't need to break them in and they didn't hurt my feet the first day I walked around with them.

These sneakers are great because it combines softness with durability and is very very beautiful.', 3970: \"Not only are they really stylish but they are well made and incredibly comfortable.  Oakley's sizing for shoes is pretty much exact in my experience.  All my Oakley shoes have fit like gloves (pardon the expression).  Unlike their sizes for sandals, which for some weird reason run small.  So, always get a size larger for sandals, but shoe sizes are right on.  Weird, I know, but very true.  Any way, you will not be disappointed in these or any Oakley footwear.  I highly recommend!\", 3971: 'Great shoes and sharp looking fits snugg very true to size .......Defenatly will purchase more in future...', 3972: \"A very nice looking pair of shoes.

A friend of mine recommended Oakley, saying they were incredibly comfortable. I work in EMS and have been using these boots for the past 8 months with not one complaint. They are extremely comfortable and have held up amazingly. So far I have noticed hardly any wear and tear at all other than typical sole wear from using them so much. I'm a female and wear a 7.5 and ordered the 6 in men's and they fit great with insoles. I get tons of compliments on them too and have almost talked anyone who asks about them into purchasing a pair for themselves.\", 3977: 'I am pleased with these boots.It is stylish and the function is also excellent.Although an order was placed from Japan, it arrived immediately.Thank you, Amazon.com', 3978: 'Excellent boots.Great Quality.Great Price on Amazon.True to size.Definately NOT water resistant.Comfortable right out of the box.This is my 3rd pair of Oakleys boots (first time purchasing the Sabot High 2.0) since I have been in the middle east and I will CONTINUE to buy Oakley every time.', 3979: 'Super and very conftable glad I bought them!Quick delivery and good customer service.

I hope Oakley  never stop making these Boots. Soldiers On! US AMRY\", 3986: \"I bought these with a wind gasket kit for eye protection on my sport bike. The sunglasses themselves were almost %25 cheaper from Amazon than direct from Oakley's website, so even with the accessory it was less than I expected to spend. I wasn't disappointed either when the weather was finally fit enough to get my bike out. Oakleys are pricey, but they make excellent lenses, and I had no trouble with the frames comfortably keeping wind and particles out of my eyes at highway speeds. Even at full retail it would've been worth the investment.\", 3987: 'I really enjoy these pair of glasses.  They fit perfectly and was exactly what I was looking for in a pair of sunglasses.', 3988: \"Over years I've purchased many shades from different brands.  The feature I found most useful beyond the typical UV protection and cool look is interchangeable lenses. This adds to the life of your shades by not forcing you to buy a new $100+ pair everything's the lenses scratch.  If you're even moderately into sports while wearing shades, you're bound to drop/scratch them at some point.  Interchangeable lens systems will save you lots.\", 3989: \"Oakley Men's Split Jacket are by far the best glacier glasses I have ever worn on mountaineering expeditions, perfect for all sports, training or just hanging outside.

The lenses have a superior quality and very resistant to mud and dirt. The next upgrade for me will be the purchase of vented lenses. Strongly recommend!', 3993: 'This sunglasses fits perfectly , exactly what I need it and I love them. I highly recommended this sunglasses for every men that expect the best in sunglasses quality.

The main feature that I valued is the interchangeable lenses.  The G40 lenses are not dark enough though.  I will be getting some more lenses soon.', 4003: \"Ok, I got these for use on my motorcycle where lighting conditions can change fast and it is impractical to remove your sunglasses just because you went into a tunnel or pass through a shady area.  they do respond to changing light conditions at a reasonably quick pace.  As with most photochromic lenses they do not get all that dark.  I do love the style, construction and even the finish (silver ghost text).  These are cool Sunglasses!  I even purchase the kit that allows me to convert my split jackets into wind jackets (the &#34;gasket&#34; and retaining strap) for riding.  They are perfect for this purpose.  I am a long time Oakley fan (all the way back to BMX grips and &#34;Blades&#34; back in the late 80's.  These meet all of my expectations and exceed them by a great deal.

Also the nose bomb help a lot to raise the glasses off the cheek.As for the performance, I don\\'t know what\\'s up with \"gold clear\" - why not just clear lens??? Must be some fancy fusion thing that I never use (straight to my tool box) The VR50 is really cool lens, I\\'m strong believer of VR28, which I almost always use unless I\\'m on the indoor range. But VR50 is very cool, gives me really great contrast of background. Doesn\\'t shut the blight sun 100%, but these are also keeper.Overall these are cool shades...and I\\'m so 2010. Ooops.', 4014: \"I have been a Oakley user for many years. I own various Oakley glasses like the legendary Juliet's, x-squared, monster dogs, straight jacket, Holbrook , jupiters and jawbones.Theses are awesome glasses for outdoor sports with variable sunlight conditions.The iridium coated transition lenses are great for low to med light conditions.They are great for trail running, mountain biking.They come with extra nose bridge for Asians fit but a small part of it still touches my cheekbones.I love the ghost text design on these glasses on gloss finish, they make them look limited edition.The black gloss ghost text motive are rather subtle, yet upon closer inspection they look very unique. That's is the buying factor for me on these glasses. It's a bit of oxymoron. Subtle yet gets attention somehow.My other pair of photochromatic are the monster dogs. I prefer these split jackets black iridium based as they don't amp up the contrast and don't give me a headache after prolong usage. Neither are they polarized as polarized give me a headache too on the polarized VR28 lenses though they cost so much.Original price of $260 is cool with fast 2day free shipping. 5*****They are excellent value and I will use them for my daily use and keep the rest of my oakley x-metals for collection and price appreciation.Perhaps the only issue if i wanted to nit pick is that the original Oakley box came in quite a sad looking condition but the glasses are perfect. The documents are complete and the soft vault is also perfect.\", 4015: 'Cross hair 2 is great, the dark black iridium lenses block the sun with clear image because of the polarized lenses. I recommend buying this product from Oakley.', 4016: 'Very nicely made Oakleys.  This is my mmm  6th pair of them and if you have a larger than average face and head like me, they will look great on you.  Which is very hard to find.  So, I would imagine they would also look great on a skinny dude.', 4017: 'I must admit, I\\'ve liked Oakley products for a long time.  I bought my first pair at 15 years old in 1996.  I saved forever to buy a pair of Full Metal Jackets (basically the high end plastic Eye Jackets).  I still have that pair today after all these years!  I bought my second pair of Oakely glasses in 1999 - a $200 pair of A-Wire polarized glasses.  Those lasted me many years as well, but when an accident meant I needed new lenses, I called Oakley to find that I couldn\\'t get my beloved A-Wire\\'s (nor could I get a pair of A-Wire 2.0 I have had since 2004) repaired.  Enter my search for a new pair of glasses.During my search I never considered any other brand but Oakley given my past experiences with their products.  Who else makes a pair of plastic glasses that have lasted since 1996!?  I\\'m also and \"action sports\" enthusiast (motocross) and Oakley\\'s image has always struck a cord with me.  That said, I wouldn\\'t just buy ANYTHING that says OAKLEY on it.  They do make a lot of things I would consider tacky, ugly, weird, or even hideous (though I\\'m sure they are quality products).  These glasses are none of those things.  Oakely didn\\'t disappoint once again.  These glasses are VERY well made, with clear/distortion free optics, have a good weight and feel to them, fit great, and are comfortable.The frames do say \"Made in China\" on them, but let\\'s be realistic, what isn\\'t made in China nowadays?  There was a point in time when everything from Oakley was made in the USA (my Eye Jackets say MADE IN USA) but I fear those days are gone.  Fortunately these are still well made sunglasses that I expect to last me a decade or more into the future.  Are they expensive?  I guess that depends on what you consider expensive, and how often you want to replace sunglasses.  Are they more than what you buy at a department store or gas station?  Certainly.  Will those cheaper glasses last you a decade or more?  Probably not.  When you think about it that way, along with the style and quality optics, these start to look like a bargain.', 4018: \"I unfortunately lost my first pair somehow, but my fiancee was nice enough to replace them for me.  They stay tight to your face and don't slide around much when you move, which is great.  No complaints for these past the typical Oakley pricetag, but in this case you get what you pay for, especially the polarized lenses.\", 4019: \"Package arrived in great shape as I have come to expect from Amazon.  The Glasses are much better than the half-wire's that I have had.  Some of the Oakley's have a spring in the arm that will break after a year or two or even quicker if you are rough on glasses like me.  These have no spring so there is basically no way these will break from normal use.  One of the lenses has fallen out, but I had dropped the glasses on the floor so not a big deal.  I love the polarization and the look of the glasses.  They look a little different than what I suspected so you may want to go to a local store and try them first.  If you are military the AAFES exchange has a cheaper regular price at one of the stores.  I didn't see it until afterward.  I still love Amazon and use it for almost everything.\", 4020: \"I have been a huge Oakley fan since the mid 90's when I purchased my first pair of Oakley Frogskin sunglasses. Since then I have owned 2 different pair of A-Wires, E-Wires, Whisker, Juliet and now these Crosshair 2.0. Out of all my Oakleys these are one of my favorites. The Juliet is my favorite pair I own but that style of sunglass does not complement a Suit very well, since they are very active lifestyle/sports design sunglasses. With that being said this is why I chose to purchase the Crosshair 2.0. I did try on a pair of the new Crosshair 2012 before deciding on purchasing the older Crosshair 2.0. The 2012 Crosshair is a true Aviator lens design and the lens size is much larger than these Crosshair 2.0. I have a large nose and the Crosshair 2012 was a little bit too big on the lens size which made my nose look even larger. The Crosshair 2.0 complements my face perfectly and still is a Aviator style which I have always loved. The lenses are the Black Iridium Polarized which in my opinion is one of the best lenses that Oakley makes, second only to the Ice Iridium polarized I have on my Juliet. The lense shade and protection is perfect for the bright Las Vegas sun. I would recommend trying these on in a store before purchasing on-line since they are a modified Aviator style lens shape. The glasses fit perfectly close to the face and the lens curvature at 8.75 is perfect to keep the sun from sneaking in on the sides. I strongly recommend this product from Oakley and as afformentioned I own many different Oakley sunglasses\", 4021: 'Suggest you go to a Sunglasses Store first to try it on, like i always do before buying it online. Cant beat the price! Fits snug, lens is super clear, better than rayban polarized.', 4022: 'I like my sunglasses a lot. Good product good price. I like how they fit. Fast shipping too. Great sunglasses for the price', 4023: \"These are a great pair of sunglasses. I have a fat face and they look great. They feel a little cheap but I have had no problems yet and it's been about 3 months. Definitely worth the price!\", 4024: \"I received this a few days ago and it fits great.  After trying the Plantiff Squared which was way too big for my cheeks this was a perfect compromise.  Quality-wise it's much better and the fit/feel is amazing.  The optics is as always extremely clear and perfect for any sunny day.\", 4025: 'I ordered these from Amazon after trying them on at Sunglass Hut.  They were $220 in the mall, paid $147 with no tax and free shipping on these (and they are polarized and legit with all paperwork), received them in 2 days with standard shipping. Could not be happier with the deal I got, and the glasses themselves fit great, are light, but feel sturdy and well made.', 4026: \"Nice sunglasses. But be carefull because they seem to be fragile. Olso I have a complain because I ordered the glasses black and they came black iridium. I don't know why.\", 4027: \"My face is little bit wide and it results in struggling me to find comfortable sunglasses.But this one fits perrfectly and and i'm falling in love with this.\", 4028: 'this sunglass is great, the view is fantastic and the best part is the material is lighter than my ray ban and give me a better protection from then sun', 4029: 'They are a great oakley product, the lead frame really sets off the black lenses.  They fit well and close to the face, the earpieces keep the nice and secure.', 4030: 'Very nice fit. Great look and very durable from what i can tell. Best of all, they actually work like they should.', 4031: 'My favorite pair of glasses. I just wish it were easier to get an Oakley lens prescription with them, but awesome glasses!', 4032: 'For metal frames, they are incredibly light weight.  Holding their shape well, so far.  The wrap around lenses are a huge help with getting hit in the face from the side with the sun.  Better than the usual plastic frames and the design is unlike anything else.', 4033: \"There is nothing better, if you are looking for a good style sunglasses. I don't know nothing about the technology applied, or if it's good for your eyes, but just like a mere user, it's perfect.\", 4034: 'I have two pair because they perform so well and provide such a versitile look.  Great on a Saturday or with a suit.  Polarization providdes clarity and the tinting is dark enough for direct sun when driving.  Less than perfect rating because the rubber pieces on the sides wear with time and deteriorate - over a period of years, not months.  Order an extra set or two.  These glasses provide great functionality combined with minimalist style.  My only other sunglasses are for running.', 4035: 'I just recently had a LASIK procedure done and I was focused on buying sunglasses to protect my eyes from the sun.  These polarized lenses do an excellent job at that.  Also the sunglasses are lightweight and I really like the aviator style.', 4036: 'The polarized lenses are great, giving a lot of confort. The frame is very light and resistant, not hurting your face even with long use. Really good product.', 4037: \"They look perfect, I like the color, the materials feel very solid. I just don't like the word &#34;POLARIZED&#34; in the lenses\", 4038: 'I love these sunglass and have had several pair.  They are extremely comfortable and great for sports and they fit snug against the head.', 4039: \"I am a proud owner of Crosshair 2.0 Polarized with Black Iridium lens. It is the zenith of quality sunglasses. I haven't spend my money on something more meaningful yet ;)\", 4040: \"I have been overwhelmed by the variety and complexity of quality sunglasses, and frankly, I had to wonder if they were really worth the money, or just expensive fashion. The Oakley Crosshair 2.0 polarized sunglasses are just what I wanted even before I knew what I wanted. They provide a clarity I didn't expect with a fit and lightness that makes you check to see if they're there. I first bought s cheaper model with darker lends, but am thrilled that I went back and exchanged for the polarized version. They were restful on the eyes in a variety of sunlight conditions in downtown Bangkok, and even worked fine inside a shopping mall. Worth the money and just...!\", 4041: 'This is my second pair of Oakleys - and they are wonderful!My 1st pair are plastic frames, and I wanted a mirrored pair...I tried this pair on in a local store, and loved the way they looked - so I scoured Amazon and found a great deal!These are very high class shades, and I recommend them highly!', 4042: \"I couldn't be happier with these sunglasses.  I bought the Polarized Polished Gold Frame and Bronze Lens version of this item, and I'm VERY happy with the results.  I chose the bronze lens because I am an avid golfer and read that the lighter yellowish tint make lighter objects appear brighter, while still providing protection from the sun to your eyes.  This turns out to be very true.  I have found it easier to locate the ball with these glasses, than the darker, more traditional ones, I had used previously.I bought my last pair of Oakley's 12 years ago (they were also polarized, but a black lens), and they lasted me quite some time.  The new glasses, with High Definition Optics, provide much more clarity over the older version (although I do question how much of that is simply a result of the older version being worn, and scratched...  None the less, the difference is amazing).It's important to note, the price is outrageous.  These are NOT really made of gold, but the way they're priced, you'd think they were!  I paid the price, because I have a history of making sunglasses last, so I don't mind spending a little extra on a nicer pair.  However, [...] for a pair of sunglasses makes it impossible to rate it a perfect 5 out of 5 (for me, at least...).I would strongly recommend you visit your local sunglasses store to try on the glasses before purchasing.  I had intended on buying a different pair of Oakley's previously, but went to my local store to try them on and make sure I like them first.  I couldn't believe how thin and flimsy their frames appeared.  I'm looking to make my sunglasses last as long as possible, so a thin and flimsy frame is not something I want.  However, it was during this same trip that I found these glasses and decided on buying.  The sales person was quick to point out there are tons of counterfeits online, so if I'm planning on buying online I better beware.  I believe this to be true.  HOWEVER, the ones I bought were sold (and shipped) directly from Amazon, which I felt was a trusty and reliable seller, and therefore I had no problems.  I would strongly suggest you buy any major sunglasses (like Oakley) from only the highest of rated sellers, with enough reviews to make you feel comfortable.  While Amazon's price for these glasses were the same as the price at my local shop, I did save about $18 because there was no tax charged and the shipping was free (although it did take slightly over a week, which Amazon is honest about.  I don't have a patience problem, so that's fine with me).\", 4043: 'The lense in these is fantastic - great in all light conditions.  And the style has tons of attitude for casual and sport use, but can go with suits as well.', 4044: \"I was looking for a pair of polarized Oakleys that were perfect for everyday casual wear, and I definitely found them here.I normally wear a pair of Serengeti Drivers for driving, as they're optimized for that task, but wanted something polarized for general wear and sightseeing. These Oakleys are stylish, very comfortable and relieve your eyes of any strain in even the brightest sunlight and most intense glare and UV situations.I haven't had any of the issues some of the other reviewers have, so given that I can only give these my highest recommendation.\", 4045: 'excellent', 4046: \"Crosshair 2.0 is one of Oakley's best products. The comfort, the look and style every aspect is very satisfactory with the comfort to. The tint could be darker. Either way overall it is a fabulous pair of shades for the style conscious people :-). Excellent Service and a good price from Amazon. I received it 1 day earlier. I love it.\", 4047: 'So happy with my sunglasses, nice style, a great sight during the day, and a natural feeling when am wearing.', 4048: 'I bought them for my hubby for his birthday! He already has a pair, so these should fit great! I received my purchase fast and in excellent condition. Thank you!', 4049: 'Sunglasses were exactly as I expected.  They are nice and light, while still being functional.  They look and feel good', 4050: \"I've had nothing but Oakley sunglasses my entire life and they never let me down. Quality is great, optics are clear and the fit is perfect.\", 4051: \"I've owned these for about 5 months now.  They look great and seem to be good quality.They come with a protective sleeve/bag to store them in when you aren't wearing them.Glad I bought them!\", 4052: \"I tried these out at the store and thought they were wide enough for my large head, and didn't sit too close to my face. When I ordered a pair, I found that the edges of the lenses were too close, so they would get sweaty and fog up. I know I could get them adjusted, but it was a little too much trouble for me to go and get these properly fitted; I ended up returning them. I'm a little disappointed that the curvature didn't match my face, since I really liked how these looked.\", 4053: 'Great product. I had gone to local Oakley store, sat on my decision because of the high price that usually comes with a pair of Oakley glasses. I might have purchased it there had the salesperson informed me of the fact that these came in a material other than titanium. I came to Amazon.com and found out I had other options available to me in this particular style.', 4054: 'Curves around the contours of my face nicely.Metal frame is a little heavier than the plastic or nano wire Oakley styles.Rubber grips prevent sliding.', 4055: 'I love Oakley!  They have the best quality products.  This product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  It is a wonderful product and I recommend it.', 4056: 'I got these for my husband and he loves them. They are comfortable, good coverage around his face and he likes how the colors are stronger. They look good on him too, which is another top criteria, lol. They were cheaper online at Amazon than at the store.', 4057: \"original sunglasses excellent high quality adaptanta is fine for thin face, I'm satisfied with the product very well protected from the sun and look great\", 4058: \"This is my third pair of Oakley's as I always seem to loose them. A couple of years ago I bought my second pair which were similar to these but I paid about $300.00 for them and they were the second love of my life. Unfortunately I lost those while hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail. A couple of years have gone by since I lost them and I kept buying cheap glasses thinking it's not worth spending the $200-$300 for them because I keep losing them.Well I saw these on Amazon and I bit. As soon as I put them on I quickly realized why I spend $200-$300 on sun glasses. The first reason is comfort. These glasses just make you feel good about yourself. Not because of the money you spent but literally because they are a perfect fit. They also have style. They are glasses that are made for a man and when you wear them you feel like a man.The Material and strength of these glasses is the second reason. You'll notice the difference between wearing cheap plastic or metals compared to these.All-round these glasses are BOSS. They are not too dark either which is great when you've been wearing LOC's for the past year or two.(I normally wear LOC's when I ride my Harley in the summer).On a scale of 1-10 I give these a solid 9. The reason I give them a 9 is because they don't replace the pair a lost a couple of years ago which I considered the ultimate best of the best for me. So that's just based on my personal experience, otherwise I would give these a 10.\", 4059: 'The quality of the glasses is strong. The only problem that i could see is that if the frame arms were flexed out it could cause the frame around the lenses to distort and pop out but again any frame design like the Crosshair is going to do that.As for look, I was looking for \"sporty\" aviators sunglasses and for me this fit the bill. They fit well on the face (I am caucasian with what i would consider an average size nose). If you have a larger nose or a more flat face I would avoid the Crosshair 2.0 because you probably won\\'t be happy.  The weight is not too noticeable on the face.Overall i am happy with the sunglasses I just wish they were a little cheaper and had a stronger tinting for those extra sunny days.', 4060: 'Loved the look of them and they came right on time! I liked the package they used to make sure they were not damaged.', 4061: \"I'll be honest, I don't think I can give an unbiased review of any Oakley product. I love all their stuff too much, and these are no exception.Great style, great UV reduction, great quality. Once you hold them in your hands you know these are going to last you a very long time.The only problem when buying Oakley is that you know you're more likely to lose them to a thief than you are to the product breaking.Keep them in a safe place!\", 4062: 'High quality product. Good fit as always. Looks fantastic for a casual look or even with a smart suit. The regular len is sufficient for driving and provides good protection for the eyes.', 4063: 'These frames are sick!!! They look cool and the lens clarity is amazing.. yes buy them if you are considering a street wear metal frame.Pro: The VR-28 (bronze) lens is ideal for cloudy days.Con: Sucks they are no longer made in USA =(', 4064: 'Fantastic quality and incredible lens clarity. These sunglasses are the highest quality sunglasses I own. They look great and they are very well designed overall. They fit comfortably, they are snug but not too snug, the field of view is very very clear and a pleasure to use. It is also good to know that they block 100 of UV light and they have just the right amount of tint. What more can you ask?', 4065: 'Muy buenos lentes de excelente calidad y material, son muy resistentes, livianos, comodos y protegen bastante del sol para no ser polarizados.', 4066: 'These shades are amazing, excellent Oakley quality but the thing I notice most is the fact that I can wear them into an office and still see OK. Super in low light.They are way ahead of my previous Ray-bans on every count. They look really good on, are comfortable, will not fall off when one bends down.I would strongly recommend them.....', 4067: 'Excelent sunglasses oakley, is perfect and the shop is responsible. I love it. The buy was send at time. 100% responsible', 4068: 'I use these on my boat all summer and was very satisfied. Sun protection wise they are not the best but worked well. Style wise they looked awesome. They also stayed on my face amazingly well which was a huge plus.I would buy these again without a doubt. Good looks, solid protection and fit well.', 4069: 'The sun glasses were just what I wanted, fit fine and came quickly at a very reasonable price.  I had been looking at Oakleys in various stores and these were priced right.', 4070: 'Oakley has always been a quality product that never disappoints...great sunglasses that wear well...I would recommend these to eveyoneThanks', 4071: \"I bought these lenses after weeks of trying on shades. They are very comfortable and hold on to my head really good without them feeling tight or moving around. You can even look down without them falling off. I have some pros and cons for you to consider, I've used them for about a year now so I can let you know what I really think of them._________________________________Pros:Great look (I have a thin face and usually large lenses don't look good on my but these do)They are very comfortable (hold on tight enough to not fall off but you actually forget you are wearing them after a while)Solid construction, metal frame is lighter than it looks and feels really good in the hand (not cheap at all)Polarization is really good, really helps when driving, boating, etc.No squeaking or rattle even after using them daily for about a year._________________________________Cons:I live in a tropical country, what I like to call beach weather year round and we have a lot of sun and few clouds. The cool gray color of the lens is too light for climates like mine. Even with the shades on sometimes I feel like i'm walking around with my eyes shut. I would highly recommend oakley to make some darker lenses.The rubber in the legs is kind of silicone and they stretch as usually silicone does. It starts expanding up to a point it goes over its groove and looks odd. Although even stretched does not move or come off, therefore I won't replace them any time soon (I hope)_________________________________At the end I really like these sunglasses, pros are higher than cons and probably in the future I would buy another pair if needed.For the present time, I have a few scratches right in the middle of my focal point so I will probably look for darker replacement lenses, G-15's probably since they combine well balanced colors and protection.\", 4072: 'These are very high quality sunglasses that fit anyone perfectly. They stay on your face perfectly no matter what your doing.  The were shipped quickly also. I have had no issues with them. I have had no problems with the smell of the glasses as well. Smell great!', 4073: \"Cool as all my Oakley's have been... Bigger than I expected but I got used to it. I pretty much stick to Oakley's and will probably get another pair if I break or lose these.\", 4074: \"These are exactly as described and they fit and are awesome! The only downside is that they don't block out the sun very well :/ (it's not horrible! but it's just not as good as other shades) other than that they are rockin!!UPDATE! 7/25/12These shades are indestructable! (more or less) I was at a water park and I had them on. I was doing the line dances that were playing over the speakers and the glasses flew off my head and projectiled into a curb! They didn't have a scratch on them. They may be expensive, but they are made to last!\", 4075: 'My husband loves  them, are fantastic and the color also, this sunglasses are wonderful and look masculine. the perfect gift for a guy', 4076: 'Not much to say, its from oakley and worth every penny. just make sure it fits you before buying online.', 4077: 'This past summer was a horrible summer for any sunglasses I touched. I went through about a dozen cheap pairs that I picked up from local brick and mortar stores. Sitting here I realize that, if I were to add up the cost of all these cheap sunglasses, I could of bought a couple of very nice pairs. I have only owned cheap sunglasses and I wondered if paying a premium on sunglasses is worth it.Enter the Oakley Mens Crosshair sunglassesI picked these up because they came to my attention being apart of a sale. I was hesitant due to even the sale price but, as I mentioned beforehand, just a few cheap pairs would cover the cost of these glasses.They arrived in the mail and come pre-packaged in a simple cardboard box. Within the cardboard box the glasses are protected in a soft cloth bag and also contain a cleaning rag and small info brochure.I immediately pulled out the glasses and spent the next few hours walking around trying them on and, have to say, I am pretty impressed.Many of my cheap glasses broke due to poor construction of the frames. These frames feel durable and like they will last. I have a large head that does put tension on glasses. These glasses were able to take the tension yet retain their original shape.The glasses are not polarized but do a good job on their own protecting my vision from the suns glare. The lenses are the perfect tint and did not block out my vision of the outside world.I received compliments from my wife and neighbors about how stylish the glasses look. It reminds me of the hoopla during the 80\\'s when Tom Cruise sported \"Aviator\" glasses from the movie Top Gun and the craze he created.PRO:++ Durable construction++ Compliments on how stylish they lookCON:++ For price, only receiving a cloth bag for protection is cheapCONCLUSION:These glasses are well worth the premium paid over regular sunglasses you find sitting on a carousel rack at the local brick and mortar stores. Just watch for the sales when they go on to pick up then.', 4078: 'I bought these sunglasses for $112.

I trusted the brand name enough to not worry about them fitting well or being comfortable.  Went through 2 pairs of cheap sunglasses in one month, definitely can tell the upgrade in quality going to the Oakleys.  Much more sturdy and they fit well.  Only \"complaint\" I had was that I felt they did not look like the picture of the product.  Both the frame and lens appeared to be darker on the product photo when ordering.  The frame is chrome with no black tint.  Satisfied with the product, but feel that if I would have went to a store to see several types in this price range, I probably would have chose something different.', 4082: 'Pros:Very hard to scratch lenses.

Found them much cheaper here on Amazon. She loves the frame and it doesn't look too big on her smaller frame face.  She had them adjusted to fit squarely at her optometrist office and just loves them.  They have a nice comfortable rubber wrap where they rest over the ears so it makes them comfortable to wear for a longer time.  She drives a lot for work and the lens has a high protection rating (3), highest you can get in an Oakley lens that is still rated for driving.  The only higher rating (4) is not recommended for driving.  They look super!\", 4084: 'I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend these sunglasses to anyone seeking a comfortable fit for a great price.', 4085: 'Excelente', 4086: \"So when people complement me on theses glasses and ask where they can buy them, I lie.

You can drop them, step on them, let them sit in a puddle of mud, or do anything else and they'll be fine. I got these because they keep the rugged construction of the brand but with a less sporty look. I wear them casually pretty much everywhere I go.

I carry the glasses around on a red velvet pillow and set them at least 50 feet from water. I am just kidding, but from the week I have had them they have yet to get a scratch or show any signs of deteriorating.Style:With the amount of customization you can do to these you cannot complain about the style of these. They are fashionable stylish and very convenient.Lenses:You cannot deny the pure aww when you put on your first pair of Oakley sunglasses. The lenses will blow you away. This is my first polarized lenses, and I am so happy I went the extra mile with the polarized. Crisp, clear, and the ability to block the sun is all you want in your lenses, and you get all three of those with Oakley lenses.Price:the sky is the limit when it comes to how much you want to pay for quality sunglasses. Oakley tends to run on the expensive side, but you will not regret buying these sunglasses. Even though you pay an arm and a leg for them you will be glad you payed the extra arm because you will not need to buy another pair like this for a solid 5 years.Hinges:Hinges are very important in sunglasses. When I got these the hinges were squeaky and kind of catchy, but the more you use them the more the oil gets moved around and becomes more fluid. Now my hinges don't squeak at all and are very smooth.This is one of the best gifts I have ever received in my life. These glasses will change the way you look at Oakley, and will forever change your mind about sunglasses. Whenever I need to buy some more glasses, or whenever somebody asks me what type of sunglasses they should buy I always recommend Oakley.\", 4116: 'Light weight and feel great! Solid Oakley quality!  I love the way they fit on my face.  Very secure and I can wear them for hours without them becoming uncomfortable.', 4117: 'I&#8217;ve most always worn Ray Ban sunglasses, I saw these at a local retailer and really liked them. The frames feel much better than the Ray Ban styles I&#8217;ve worn in the past and the ones I am replacing with these. These Oakley Holbrook sunglasses are probably the most comfortable sunglasses I&#8217;ve ever worn.The lenses are crystal clear and plenty dark enough to suite me.', 4118: 'The amber lenses are a little light but the fit is great.  I might switch these out for a darker lens', 4119: 'This sunglasses is very comfortable, and the polarized lens is great in high luminosity.Very light on face.The polished version is prettier than matte version.I got them for $120, a very good price!I recommend the purchase.', 4120: 'these glasses are dope as shizz.... 1st off I like that they completely hide my eyes behind the 24k iridium. 2nd they are dark, but not too dark where i need to take them off if a cloud comes out. They are crystal clear and light weight. However the lenses are very sensitive little buggers. I dropped them lense first and have a few little nicks in the iridium coating. :( Definitley recommend these glasses to anyone who wants to creep on the beach without getting caught or people who just want to look like a baller.', 4121: 'These are nice glasses. Super light weight. They are comfortable and have good coverage for not having wrap around lenses.', 4122: 'VERY GOOD PRODUCTwhy did you choose this rating?elejida that the product is goodwhat did you like or dislike?I like the brand and quality finishwho would you recommend this product to?I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL', 4123: 'i got these for my boyfriend and he loves them! They are such nice sunglasses! Oakleys have a nice reputation and all guys would like a pair. Just picking the right kind of style will be the challenge!', 4124: 'I wanted something a little different than the rayban wayfarer and Oakley is by far my favorite brand for sunglasses. They came with polarized lenses and I also bought the red iridium replacement lenses. I want another pair!', 4125: 'Within the few first weeks of buying it, I was having regrets. I have now had this pair for over four months and I have really grown to love them. The visual quality is a lot better than my other sunglasses and the feel is even better. I use them whenever I drive and have tried using them for biking. I would not recommend using them for biking because it directs an airflow directly past the sensitive inside part of your eye. Be very careful about the lenses since I have had a few scratches even though I always have them either on my shirt or in the microfiber bag when not in use.', 4126: \"Pros: Excellent polarized lenses, light frames, great construction, no metal screws or partsCons: needs a larger carrying caseI've been wearing Spy's for years now and decided to give another brand a try. It was a toss up between Oakley and Von Zipper, in the end I felt the Oakleys best fit what I was looking for. I did some research to find the correct arm sizes and lens shapes; as I recommend you do to since not everybody has the same size face.A word about the seller &#34;IslandSurf&#34;: When I purchased these I received them in a timely manner but when I opened the box there was nothing inside except a empty Oakley box. I contacted the seller immediately and they were great. They responded quickly and politely. They were apologetic and promised to fix this within a specific time frame. The crazy part, is that they did. I was in constant contact with them and the issue was resolved faster than the timeline that they promised it within. : ) As you can imagine I was not happy about the whole situation, especially since this is what people fear when buying online; however they squished all fears I might have had due to their great customer service. I did eventually receive my Oakleys, which are fantastic, and have had zero problems with them or the seller.\", 4127: 'Best pair of sunglasses i have ever purchased. The bronze lens makes everthing outside awesome!The frames are great too, sturdy but light. They look good & sure to last a long time!', 4128: 'Smexy looking glasses.....', 4129: \"These are great casual  sunglasses.  If you don't quite like the classic wayfarer (Frogskin) design,  with its rounded eyepieces,  but want something similar  with plenty of coverage,  give these a try.  I have a large face and head,  and there are so many Oakleys I'm unable to wear,  but these fit perfect.  No slippage or sliding down on my nose bridge and the ear stems are just the right length.  Oakley does excellent work in taking iconic designs and tweaking and altering them just enough to create something new and fabulous,  and the Holbrooks are just that.  The 24k lens is a deeper,  as well as more opaque gold  lens than its gold iridium cousin.  I don't normally wear colored/mirrored lenses,  but  when I tried these on,  I knew they were the ones.  Highly recommended.\", 4130: \"These sunglasses are so freaking awesome!! They fit perfectly, look great, and they're Oakley...what more could you ask for? And at a great price! I have two other pair of Oakley sunglasses but these are by far my favorite.\", 4131: \"Well from the picture I though it was going to have light blue lenses but as it turns out they're purple. They turn blue at an angle. Either way I loved them. They're a great!!! It arrived way ahead of time and the packing was great!!

They are super light, seem durable, and look great. I\\'ve never owned \"expensive\" glasses, and now I can see myself picking up one or two more pairs of these.

Highly recommended.However, I asked where I could go to get a single prescription lens put in, and they sent me to Lenscrafters, who wanted $330 for the lenses, and with tax that would be $360. I said no thanks and Costco put them in for under $90. Who's happy now? I am.\", 4158: \"I love this sunglasses, even when they're red, you can see perfectly good through them.

The first was one of my favorite pairs of sunglasses I've owned.  They looked great and fit perfect.  Unfortunately I found them in the driveway in a mangled wreck.  I must have dropped them and run over them. Amazon didn't stock the original color I had so I figured I'd give these a try. I ordered these up but didn't realize just how blue they really are.  They still look pretty good, but they are a little more than I had expected.  Just be careful when selecting your colors on this one.  Sunglasses are great, but it's tough to get a feel for the colors online.\", 4160: 'The glasses are with the amazing considering prize and good quality.Just the right size.It just seems to be valuable..', 4161: \"It's a great pair of sunglasses.

I enjoy them very much.', 4176: \"The sun glasses are amazing, everything i could hope for. However, Oakley doesn't offer any sort of scratch repair or warranty or anything. I got a slight scuff in one of the lenses, i tried to call Oakley and they want me to buy another set of lenses for $80. I mind as well just buy a new pair.\", 4177: 'Very light, well made construction and the polarized Oakley lenses are excellent. these are my primary driving sun glasses. interchangeable lens make it easy to switch up the style', 4178: \"From the front, they are a bit on the wide side. I am only referring to the look though, the fit is normal. The wide lense look seems to be normal or in style right now, so it's likely intentional. These are very nice glasses and seem durable like most Oakley's.\", 4179: \"The Holbrooks are a great set of sunglassse from Oakley. I feel I probably should have saved the amount of money I paid - but I really wanted a set. They could be stronger, the hinges feel a little weak, and they will scratch if you're not paying 100% attention to them. All in all, a very stylish set of sunglasses - I recommend them to anyone.\", 4180: \"When I first saw these I was going to return them because they looked to large. but then I put them on.

Over all the sunglasses are great', 4184: \"BLUF: Great looking frames, but the lenses are strange.The frame is great. No complaints at all. The design may be different than you're expecting. It is not a typical tortoise design. The frame is brown and the black parts are etched in, whereas it's usually a swirl of the two colors. I'm still very happy with the frames. They are very unique. The frame is also very comfortable, which stands true for all Oakleys. They are very light weight and after a few minutes you forget that you're even wearing them, except for the high-def colors that are generated from the lenses.The lenses, on the other hand, I am not fond of. When they say 24k gold, they don't mean kinda gold. They are full on gold with complete reflection. They don't look bad, just awkward, because the brown and gold don't mesh very well.  I plan on buying the bronze polarized lenses. If you do like the way the colors look buy them. They create a very warm look, and enhance colors very well.I am overall very happy with this purchase, but do plan on changing lenses.\", 4185: \"I gave five stars because they got here in a reasonably amount if time. Packaged very well in the original Oakley's box. No damage. And they fit perfect. Love the style. Showed my girlfriend and she fell in love. So I ordered her a pink pair.\", 4186: 'These are Wayfarers for people with bigger heads. If you have a large noggin these will fit more comfortably but give you that same retro style. Love the looks of mine but be careful the Iridium Coating seems to scratch easily.', 4187: \"These are very cool but not to extreme that you can't wear them everyday. The frames are glossy black and the lenses are as advertised. The only thing I don't like is that on very sunny days they are not very effective and I find myself still squinting to see things. Other than that they are nice.\", 4188: \"The best Oakley's ever!!! I changed the lenses and get people asking about them everyday I wear them, also have a matte black and people like the crystal blue more so!!\", 4189: \"I have a hard time finding sunglasses that fit without pinching my nose.  I drive sometimes 6-8 hrs a day and finding a comfortable sunglass that cuts the glare hasn't been easy.  I tried on my original pair of Oakley's in a mall shop and bought them.  Loved them, so purchased the second pair.  I've had tons of compliments on them and would definitely buy again.\", 4190: \"these sunglasses exceeded my expectations by 100%. very comfortable, clear vision, spectacular design.

I had them for about three weeks and have been enjoying them about everyday.', 4198: \"I wear them to drive often and the best part is that after a couple minutes you totally forget your wearing them. The lenses are optically perfect so it looks like you're not wearing anything\", 4199: \"sick shades in all attires mate!  Can't go wrong with this design, even with my narrow face!  This is the design that gets away from the Ray Ban wayfarer.  SWAG!\", 4200: \"These glasses fit pretty much as expected. A person with a head larger than mine may find them a bit tight, but the plastic will wear into a perfect fit over time. Compared to the picture, you'll find that they're even more glam/throwback than you'd probably expect, but I think that it's in an awesome way. These are some bold, statement-making shades!\", 4201: \"So, for those wanting the green iridium, just know that the lenses are not actually green. The picture is not correct at all for them. They look more like a mirrored yellow, like alligator eyes. Although, if you're standing above some green grass they'll look more green!\", 4202: 'Awesome sunglasses.  These are hard to find but leave it to Amazon...good job!

Slight blue tint.  Great in shady areas or cloudy days, not to dark.  Still a tad bright in bright sunny days if you are used to a darker lens.  Highly recommend.', 4232: \"I bought mine at an Oakley store where it was easier to customize (select frame color first, then whatever lens color/style you want), but as long as you find a frame/lens combo you like here, you're golden.

Nice fit for my face and I bought script lenses in Fire Iridium....it looks pretty crazy, but looks just as good as the 24K lenses and both colors work great with the Tortoise shell frames ....I've scared some dogs and some have scared me with the red/orange/yellow lenses though. I have the yellow lenses also, which I will wear when I wear my contacts.  The lenses are easy to pop out just be careful and have clean hands, my optician showed me how to take the lenses out to switch them out. Oakley script lenses are expensive though like @$300.

These glasses are pretty new in the market and is eye catching specially with the gold lenses. My first choice was the polished black body but returned it because the body easliy gets scraches on them. This was my second choice, and I still loved it.

Wish I could still return it and buy it here.', 4245: 'These are great sunglasses. A little more streamlined and sporty then the Club Masters. Lightweight, awesome high quality lenses, and the frame fits like a glove. When I first tried them on they pinched, but the frame is made out of a soft material, so now they are very comfy. The clothespin-looking bridge is a little odd at first, but it doesn\\'t detract from the overall aesthetic once you get use to seeing it.  For $110 Oakley should throw in a hard case and a better \"lens cleaner\" that doesn\\'t function as a \"case\".', 4246: \"I love the look for these glasses. They're bold, but a little old school, too. The matte black finish isn't too flashy, but still looks good.

Just kidding. Actually the truth is i sold my ray ban wayfarers because when i got them few people were wearing them and now that everyone is i wanted to go a bit different. I just hope these dont become the next way farers. They are nice sunglasses even though i always thought oakleys for a little flashy for my style these look more laid back as long as you dont go for a bright tacky color like Guy Fieri would.

Would definitely recommend.\", 4266: \"Oakley's are one of the best polorized lenses - I would say next to Maui Jims as I own one of those since 3 years and they are still intact just as new.Coming back to Holbrook - These are the great shape and cool shade glasses.

Love these sunglasses.', 4273: 'Oakley makes excellent shades and eyewear for that matter.  I have many Oakley sunglasses and this pair is no exception.  The only thing I have a problem with is that the lenses are not polarized.  Ever since I had eye surgery, my eyes are more sensitive to light and polarized lenses help that a lot.  I like the color and shape of the Holbrook and like all other oakley shades, the lenses are easy to change if need be and if the sunglasses are dropped or the arms come off, you can just pop them back in.  The lenses offer sharp and clear images without any distortion.  I will definitely be purchasing many more pairs of Oakleys.', 4274: 'My young adult son asked for these for Christmas. Waaaaay too expensive for my taste but they are what he wanted and he loves them.', 4275: 'These are great glasses.  I purchased them for my recent trip to the Caribbean and they did a great job.

Delivery wasn't that long and pretty reasonable. Took about 2 weeks before my item came at my doorstep.Item is as described and pretty reasonable for the price too. Bought 2 pairs and my best frd love it too!\", 4279: \"They look good, nice color in the lens. Very comfortable. BTW: If you have a wider face, I'd go with a large size, not medium like these.They are very light as advertised. The frame doesn't have spring hinges, so be mindful of that.The lenses are not flush with the frame on the inside, probably because of the 3-point construction to eliminate distortion. The vision IS really clear though. However, because the lens material is so light weight, they look and feel plastic.Besides the comfort, these are not worth the price IMO. I would pay about $70 max..but that's just me. I find myself preferring these over my darker polarized glasses, because I can see out of them better. They are comfortable, probably one of the most comfortable I have worn. I initially gave these 3 stars, but after wearing them for a little while, I changed it to 4. I have bought a few pairs of sunglasses since buying these, and I can see that the quality is there compared to some others. But, still not quite worth $100. I will say that Amazon is the cheapest I found them so far.The case is great of course, huge, and comes with a silk carrying bag that's also used to wipe off smudges (not crazy about that because the bag is white and will get dirty fast).I'm just a little disappointed..and 4 stars for look and comfort only.\", 4280: 'rapido el envio son muy bonitos a buen precio ademas excelente el tamano perfecto  el peso esta bn todo muy bien', 4281: 'beautiful!

I ordered these for Christmas and received them in the amount of time they described.  My son (who I ordered them for) and I are very pleased.', 4287: \"This may be a bit much for Amazon, but when I work out I get sweaty, really, really sweaty and these glasses stay on my head. Furthermore, since I run outside, I no longer have to squint (the summer sun in Maryland is terrible). Last, I also play baseball, right field, and I can't express how much easier these glasses make catching pop-flies. Great product.\", 4288: 'The quality is very good and they look great. However I sweat around my eyes easily and then have to pull them downthe nose to allow more air flow. Not sure how they can fix this.', 4289: \"I've always been an Oakley's fan as far back as the late 90's and used these in military. Totally customization down to the frame pieces, nose pieces and of course the lens size and color as well. Oakley's High Definition Optics are by far the way to go.\", 4290: 'My son is a baseball coach and they are outside all the time.  Eye protection is so important and these sunglasses protect his eyes and they look good too.', 4291: \"I have now worn my M-Frames for about a year, and if it's not night time or especially overcast out, I'm probably wearing them. The good thing is that they are really comfortable. They sit on the face well and you've got padding in the places where you need it. If you're not walking around thinking about your looks, they won't do anything to remind you that they're there. I appreciate that, especially because past pairs of sunglasses didn't do as good of a job.So why technically did I choose the Hybrid with Black Iridium lenses? There was a careful bit of thought that went into buying these shades because I didn't want the bigger lenses like the Heater. My face isn't that big and I though those would be a little strange. Overall, the Hybrid lens is exactly what I wanted. It does a great job of covering your field of view- and, to a lesser extend, I've found that it's relatively good at protecting your eyes when there's random crap flying around. These are not ballistic lenses by any stretch of the imagination, but don't discount the shatter resistant nature of the standard M-Frame lens.The real question, of course, is this: Can you see my eyes when I'm wearing M-Frames? The answer is no- most of the time. The real reason that your eyes will show through sunglasses is that there is light coming from behind them. With wrap-around lenses that protect the sides of your eyes, you're not going to see a whole lot of that light coming in from the surroundings and therefore, your lenses will look black to anyone on the outside. However, with models like the Strike or Hybrid, there may be some amount of light around the edges of your eyes. If you're concious of it, it won't ever be a problem. That's the thing I can never stand about Ray-Bans, be it Wayfarers or Aviators. There's simply way too much light coming in through those straight lenses and frames. I can see through them all the time- the guys with Ray-Bans are the ones that you'll catch staring.The greatest thing about them is, of course, the intended result of shading your eyes. I can happily report that the Black Irridium works very well. Most of the time, I'm rolling in urban environments with a lot of white concrete and reflective surfaces. I'm also in the outdoors where there's no shade whatsoever around and you've got to stay out on the job for a few more hours. You can get a better description of just what the lenses do at the Oakley website, but suffice it to say that they work great. Even in the brightest sunlight with all kinds of environmental effects on the light, it really does save your eyes a lot of strain. The big difference is the way that it doesn't distort colors by the time the day is over. (Note: don't expect polarization from shades that aren't advertised as polarized.) I've had some motorcycle cops tell me that they really wanted to have the same capabilities that my Oakleys have since the shades they had weren't up to that kind of standard. That's what makes the pricetag worth it.The microfiber bag you'll get with these shades is very useful as well. It's worked as advertised to keeping the lenses clean and it offers some decent protection when you're storing them.I've had very limited problems with these shades over this period of time. Like any lens, they will tend to get scratched but I haven't noticed anything that stands out. Most of them are really shallow hairline scratches that can't be observed from a few feet away. I'm not at the point of buying new lenses but that option is out there if you need it. Once I had the nose piece fall out and disappear when they were in my pocket (a dangerous place to be) and had to order a replacement. Thankfully, Oakley does a good job with their customer service and always shipped out the parts I needed right on time. When you're paying that much for your sunglasses, you'd better expect good service. How much do I like them? They're as much a part of me as my beard. They've lasted far longer than anything I've had before and they do a much better job of keeping those harmful rays out of your eyes. They look good and they do their job very well. You really can't ask for anything more, unless paying for quality is a problem. Even better than suppliers like Smith Optics, I think the Oakleys M-Frames are the best sunglasses out there on the market.\", 4292: 'My husband loves these.  He uses them for working out, going on walks, and they stay put on his head.', 4293: 'These are what I expected from Oakley, Have to love getting a true brand name product for half the price I would pay for them somewhere else.', 4294: \"Great quality for your money... if your looking for sunglasses for baseball or even just for the heck of it these are a great option to have. Don't be scared because of the price...

He has very sensitive eyes and these do a great job of protecting them. They fit well and they last forever! The nose and ear pieces are the first that go so I purchased an extra set to have on hand.

He highly recommends them for anyone looking for a good fitting, long lasting pair of great glasses!', 4297: 'Product Features says \"Lens Type: Iridium\",but at the web of oakley ,it may not covered by Iridium.So I want to confirm it.Is any one can tell me ?  thanks :-)', 4298: \"I love my Oakley sunglasses...

Phenomenally cool product and highly recommended!', 4304: 'I picked these glasses up for shooting, but now wear them for everyday use.  The lens are very clear, and not smokey. You can believe all the claims they make in the description.  You will have to clean the glasses of course, but they really do resist picking up dirt, and water.  I was cleaning my Ray-Ban, and Maui Jim two and three times a day.  I clean these glasses maybe once a week.  My only gripe with the glasses is that they ride a little high on the bridge of my nose with the smallest nubs.', 4305: 'not much to say, they are Oakley sunglasses and are everything they should be, I would purchase another pair in the future', 4306: 'Love the color of the lenses and the protection it provides. This is one listing that fits exactly as described. Ordered some lenses for my other Oakleys but it is never as described.

I own two pairs of these frames, and about 4 different sets of lenses. I am able to swap them out in seconds to meet conditions/needs/ or fashion.Saw these in this matte white and had to have!', 4316: 'Purchased these for mountain biking & hiking.

Still the same quality. No other sunglasses fit as good as these do for me.', 4319: \"I previously owned a pair of Half Jackets and since these looked similar and were a newer model I'd figure I'd try the Flak Jackets out. There's a couple difference between the two. The Flak Jacket has a much bigger lens than the Half Jacket. I didn't think I liked this at first but as I continued to wear them I noticed that they covered ALMOST all angles that I could possibly look. The only angle they didn't is when I was looking straight down. In a days normal eye movement I'm pretty much never going to look at that angle anyway. The second difference is the sides of the frame. The Half Jacket is more rounded on the sides and the Flak is smooth and straight. Supposedly, this is to give you all day comfort. With both pairs you can get different colors of interchangeable lenses and earsocks/nosepieces. I'm a Duke fan so I like to get blue earsocks with a blue lens. It looks great with the white frame. In my experience the Oakley sunglasses on Amazon need a great deal of work! Some of the titles on these sunglasses say one kind of style and the picture shows a completely different one. I've called Amazon numerous times about questions I've had and I haven't had one customer service rep answer my ?. The most helpful piece of info they told me was to trust the description more than the picture. So buy cautiously when looking for Oakley's on Amazon. Everything was as described with the Matte White Frame/Jade Lens XLJ's. They also come with a nice vault and storage bag to clean them. Overall, I was happy.\", 4320: 'simply put...very stylish, comfortable, shades. form fitting to the face.

Very helpful for keeping me alive.The only down side is they do scratch fairly easily, so I recommend you keep your sunglasses in a case or bag when not in use.Also try not to let beetles hit them when you're going 70mph, that will leave a mark.\", 4361: 'Excelentes lentes de sol. Todo muy bien. El vendedor es muy atento y resolvi&oacute; un peque&ntilde;o inconveniente de disponibilidad de inmediato.', 4362: \"These are the best sunglasses I have ever owned!! A bit pricey but I'll never own nothing but oakleys now!! They fit perfectly!! I wear these on my motorcycle and they don't ever move on my face, others I have bought over the years seem to fall and I have to keep pushing them up on my face!! These are the best!!!\", 4363: \"I am very pleased with the lenses, but I'm also disappointed that they didn't come with the provided cloth bag!\", 4364: 'These lens are just like any oakley lens which are just awesome!The color is very nice... perfect for my black frame', 4365: 'If you have a pair of Oakley XX X Metals, now is your chance to buy an extra pair of original lenses. This particular frame has been discontinued and the lenses will be too soon. As expected, fast shipping (prime eligible)', 4366: 'In my opinion these are one of the best models Oakley has come out with to date. I have worn many different Oakley models during combat operations throughout my tours in Iraq while serving in the Army Infantry. Although Oakley has discontinued sales of this model on their main site they are still easy to find,and there are many different color schemes for the frames as well as many different choices when it comes to lenses. I would surely recommend the CANTEEN to any Oakley enthusiast, or someone looking for a well made/stylish pair of eye wear. So, if you are still on the fence with your decision about buying this model take my advice...hit the add to cart button, and enjoy one of the best pair of glasses available while you can still find them!', 4367: 'Like the glasses but the service was poor. Paid for 2 day delievery but it took 6 days to arrive.', 4368: 'I too have owned a few pairs of different shades over the years. Nothing even comes close to the functionality , durability and overall look like these canteens. They have traveled with me overseas in extremely rugged conditions and they take a licking and keep on ticking. I have been in ocean/river/wet conditions, sand, jungle/tropical, Mediterranean climates and almost everything in between and they have held up way beyond anything i could have hoped for. they have nice side eye protection so an added bonus is they can be used in gun ranges with no issues. i have actually completed some training courses at various ranges/locations and wearing these shades has always done the trick.they feel super light and fit you dead on without being too tight, just snug enough. an added bonus is that they are also stylish and slick so you can wear them on social outings and not look out of place. i often wear hats and they fit nice and snug without being too tight or displacing the hat.they have traveled various parts of the world with me and they have served me right in every way, a trusty companion in a tool set if you venture outdoors or operate in a place where eye wear is recommended . . i had mine fitted with custom prescription lenses to enhance them further.the only wear and tear at this point is a bit of peeling on the inside of the nose mount and tearing of the rubberized tips near the ears( which can be replaced Im sure) . i value these so much that when i realized i left them at my buddies house i waited two hours for him to come back so I can get them.if you are active and require a mix of elite durability and function along with some high style get these while you can.', 4369: 'I had purchased these before and got white ones at home but Military requires black ones xD I wanted polished ones but now I am trying to locate Matte Black ones but overall this is what I needed light weight, tight fit, and great for out door use you can also replace the lenses if need be with new ones I wish Oakley would bring them back too.', 4370: \"I think others have mentioned how the build of the glasses doesn't seem up to par for Oakleys, but after wearing them for a while I have found them to be OK.  I gave them 4 stars because the side pieces that go around your head do seem a little flimsy, but they seem to be holding up so far.  I think they look good.  At first I thought they fit a little weird and let too much light in because the lenses seemed smaller then my old Oakleys, but I got used to it after a little while.  I really like the shade of the lenses as you can still see with them on when it is partly cloudy outside.  So they aren't too dark to wear when it might not be really sunny out.\", 4371: \"These glasses are great for overcast days where you don't want to block to much light but the UV rays.  Love them.\", 4372: \"I hadn't really heard of Revo before, but I liked it when i tried them on.  The fact that these are eco friendly, using reclaimed resin is a nice bonus and its impressive given that these look and feel very sturdy, light, and comfortable.  The lenses themselves are great, I've worn them pretty regularly for a week without needing to wipe em just yet.  The fact that a microfiber cloth and nice case are included are also nice touches (I have the graphite lenses, which maintain fairly true colors).  If you're looking for real sunglasses with some added durability/athletic features, these are excellent.\", 4373: 'I own 3 diff pairs of these sunglasses and they are really nice , especially nice to use when driving and theres any kind of water ie rain with reflection of the sun coming off the road , these sunglasses completely destory the reflection. theres no such thing as oakley chasms so i have a hard time believing his packing paper was labeled as that and even if it was who cares ... i would definatly recommend these sunglasses. if theres a sunglass hut store near you , go try them on but you can get a better price here on amazon though', 4374: \"Very light. Much more than my first pair of Revo Discern's. I am assuming its the titanium alloy.All in all love the crispness of the lenses.\", 4375: \"This is my second pair. The first pair lasted (me) seven years. They look great, fit my face, and I really think the spring hinges help their longevity. The crispness of the lenses is amazing. I can look at tree and see which parts are dead with these things, the color enhancing is the best and works well in both sunny and overcast skies. Even my Oakley's that were dark enough for sunny skies were not crisp in overcast light (I had to have a 2nd lighter pair). With these, one pair fits every condition (except night).\", 4376: 'Had these glasses for over two years. Very durable and comfortable. I purchased them after having Lasik surgery and have purchased three others since. Best brand out there.', 4377: 'Very good fit, maybe a little tight for some people. I am considering purchasing another pair in another color. Buy them!', 4378: \"I purchased my husband's first pair of Revo's last summer. He loves the brown tint, says there is no glare or shadowing. He is rather tough on his glasses whether they disappear or they break down... this particular pair he cherishes. The bows are spring loaded which has deflected blows towards the head/face without damaging the glasses (that sounds silly but while playing with children or participating in contact sports while wearing the sunglasses...).I've noticed that when the bows are folded up to place in a pocket, the ends of the ear pieces, which are metal, will rub and scratch the inside of the lens where there is contact because the end or tip of the bow is not enfolded with a softer material such as rubber or whatever they use to soften the resting point above the ear. If they'd only bring that softer material a bit further to envelope the ends, we'd have the perfect pair of sunglasses! That is my only complaint and as far as I know my husband's only issue as well. Great, great pair of sunglasses otherwise.\", 4379: \"I have had 3 pairs of these sunglasses. First two were purchases at Sunglass Hut, last one was purchased here. I really like the light weight frame, it's made of titanium, so very lightweight. The shape contours your eyes nicely, for me, no sun comes through from the top near the forehead, which is nice. The bronze lens is just right IMO, it's dark enough for full sunshine, but not too dark.My only negative is that my first pair, the tiny screw holding the lens inside the frame broke in half without any abuse at all, it simply broke in my hands one day. I have yet to have it fixed, but I'm told you can bring it to an optometrist and they can dig out the broken screw and put in a new one, we'll see.\", 4380: 'The perfect choice! I bought two pair! A tight fit but they stay in place in high wind conditions. Great for the desssert and bike riding.', 4381: 'I purchased these sunglasses assuming they were REVO Waypoint like the pictures and not Oakleys as stated in the description.  The sunglasses I reiceved were REVO Waypoint and they are great sunglasses.  Thye are a little tight around my temples but aside from this are great sunglasses that feel solid and well made and are a pleasure to use on bright sunny days on the water.', 4382: \"I agree that the arms are a bit tight, but I have a big head(7 3/4 hat size).  The arms do break in a little. If they're still tight, take them to Sunglasses Hut and have them reformed or heat them up with a hair-dryer and tweak them a bit.  If you're of a normal build, youll likely be fine.  I bought these strictly for function and not at all for style, as I prefer The classic designs like the older Ray-Ban's.  I got a LOT of compliments on these because of the square lenses. They're big and cover my entire eye socket, but dont look goofy because theyre a masculine square instead of a girly circle.  The lenses are glass and fully polarized, giving me a great, non-glare view of the road.  I love my Wayfarers and Aviators, but they sit off your face slightly and any light coming from the side and behind can glare or reflect off the frames and crate ghosting- no big deal in normal life, but I like to drive a Ferrari at 150mph and need an absolutely perfect view of the road...I mean the track...yeah, the track.  I got the last pair of Black with Red pinstripes, which match my car, and paid $125 because I think these are 2012/early2013 models and were on CLEARANCE at my local Sunglasses Hut in June '13.  The retailer I bought from on Amazon was very fast to ship free and didnt charge sales tax.  If you HATE OAKLEYS the way I do, then consider these as they are much toned down and function better than the more elegant &#34;classic&#34; styles.  The lenses are unbeatable and since they're glass, you can wipe them with a kleenex or soft tshirt if you get in a pinch.  One fault...the case is a bit cheesy and REALLY HUGE, so I slip these in a Crown Royal bag and stow them in my console in my go-fast-machine.\", 4383: \"Gave a Christmas Gift and was recieved with great &#34;I've Scored!&#34; enthusiasm. After his first bike race with them on everyone was sold on the comfort and styling.  The night driving lens are wonderful as well.

Each generation tries to make the time their own I suppose.I wish they didn't cost what they do (for just what they are) but it seems to make him happy and the last pair was still holding up great after 3 years of nearly around the calender wear and tear from a young teen.\", 4388: \"I have gone from Oakleys to rays to rudy to tag heuer and finally back to oakleys again.

I bought them to run more than fish.  The Oakley run specific are usually not polarized and these were.  They fit good, look good and are basically awesome.  They cut the glare considerably.

I've had the same type for a while and it works perfect for any type of activity, like in the shooting range or just going for a run. It's definitely worth the money.\", 4414: \"This replacement lens is just like the original except that the nose piece is now attached and not removable. The previous design was easier to clean because, with the nose piece removed, it was one, big, flat surface. Now it's a little harder to clean around the nose area. Otherwise, the replacement has the same color and good optical quality as the original.\", 4415: \"First of all, Oakley? Who knew! Killer pants, I was so suprised by how nice they are, they are a heavier, poly blend and feel pant, long and lean thru the thigh and end in a fabulous bootcut, they sit on the low waist but no yanking up or twisting, full gusset, thick enough for no undies. (I really prefer one layer, multi tasking pants. I have a lot of 'me' to fit into pants so I look for clean, flat lines everywhere) I bought these in a large but they were too big. I bought a medium and they are perfect. I'm 5'7, weigh 163lbs, curvy build so maybe size down in general. I'm totally happy with these pants. If you can get them for under $50, do so. Otherwise, look for Zella. They last forever.\", 4416: \"these Oakley bottoms are fantastic, comfy and great quality.  I wear them everywhere, for workout, for shopping, for hanging around the house.  They are my favorite go to bottoms.  The fit is great, no extra material or uncomfortable seams. I've had them a while and the color is still great, not faded.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of casual bottoms.\", 4417: \"This hoodie is high quality - it's warm, comfortable and looks great. I normally hate hoodies because it feels like the weight of the hood tugs the hoodie towards my back. But this one is very comfortable. The fit is perfect for a medium, the sleeves have a slightly longer cuff than I'm used to, but that's because of the thumb hole allowing you to keep your sleeve from scrunching up.The external texture is a little on the rougher side, by a twinge, probably due to the water repellency. The navy blue is a very dark blue...almost black. I wish I bought a different color, maybe the gray but still, it's a perfect hoodie in all other aspects.\", 4418: \"I'm a 55 yr old jock. I love my old worn out sweatshirts and I love my red Oakley. This thing is warm, comfortable, tough and water resistant. I'm back to order another one in a different color!\", 4419: \"Bought it like 3/4 of a year ago and used it in winter well i lived in Illinois and it kept me warm well I went out to run or even just being outside *note I'm use to cold temperatures so how a person use to warm climate might fair I'm not sure*. But I think it shines when it's a rainy day because this will keep you dry from waist up, even in a heavy down pour. Another plus about this hoodie it's it comfortable to wear and fits well around the arms, torso, and shoulders which i think are the 3 main areas a shirt type items should feel good, but that doesn't mean it's off in other areas like around the waist or stomach. Is there more i could say about this item ya, but I feel it's not needed since it's a hoodie and the rest you already know or can figure out reading the items description.\", 4420: \"I had a LOST hoodie years ago that I ironically lost. I haven't been able to find a warm hoodie with thumb holes in it. My girlfriend found this and got it for me for my birthday. I wear it all the time and am definitely getting another when this one wears out. Thats not to say that it is bad material or anything, its really great, in fact.

I definitely recommend it.', 4425: 'You can really pack a lot of stuff in this thing. Great for any over night trip. Fits on the back of my Harley also for extra storage.', 4426: 'I travel overseas about 25 times per year and this bag has been great and has held up to the terror that baggage handlers put on peoples things.

Rolls easily. Perfect size for carry on.  It would be even better if there was a water bottle net on the side.', 4430: 'I bought this bag for my husband for his birthday to go with his Oakley backpack.

It worked awesome and it looks great.', 4431: \"As a full time pilot, my luggage goes through a much higher level of wear and tear than most peoples. I bought my Oakley bag several years ago thinking I would buy something else a year later. Surprisingly, my Oakley bag is still holding up, and looks almost as good as it did when it was new. I am extremely impressed with the quality of this bag. My coworkers can't believe me when I tell them my bag is 3 years old.  I will definitely be buying another Oakley suitcase if I ever wear this one out. At 22 inches, this bag is regulation size for all airline carry on luggage. Fits in the overheads good, and holds my weeks worth of clothes easily.\", 4432: \"Excellent bag and looks great too!! I've already had several very positive comments on its look. I'll buy another, when needed.\", 4433: 'Fits well in carry-on compartment of a plane. Enough room for a weeks worth of summer clothes, & very durable.

Decided to treat myself and I am pleased with my purchase.', 4437: 'The bag everything that is described by the advertisment.  I thought that the main compartment could be a little larger.', 4438: 'I bought this backpack cause i saw it and it got my attention. so many compartments, so many ways to organize and still lots of room. Totally recommend it', 4439: 'An all round great bad. It is made from heavy duty material that will for sure last a while. While the bag does have quiet the sticker shock after receiving my bag early I can assure you it is worth every penny.', 4440: \"I got this backpack for my husband for Christmas after he had seen someone carrying it in Japan during one of his last business trips and had commented how much he liked the look of it.  The description is accurate - this is a good size bag that you can fit quite a bit in.  My husband doesn't use it for everyday use, but it is the perfect size to use for travel, camping, day-trips, etc.  He even used it as a diaper bag for our twins (it also held our laptops, and other extraneous items) on a recent plane trip.  He absolutely LOVES that the backpack has its own compartment for his Oakley sunglasses - no more having to carry a separate case around to protect them.\", 4441: 'I have wanted this bag for a while now. The price was finally right so I decided to order it. I would recommend this bag to anyone.', 4442: \"The looks:The backpack has no rivals in tough design. I've read a few reviews saying it is not a comfortable backpack, but i've found it to be one of the better packs that I've owned/tried on at stores. The metal handle up top sounds like a great idea, but it's not, it's less then comfortable and kind of small (not for those with larger hands) if you plan to use that handle at all. I often used that handle on my Swiss (Wanger?) backpack to lift it before putting it on. Not a big deal as i killed that habit after a few days.The straps are nicely shaped. If you are hiking a while, I found the straps to create a more comfortable fit (especially the top strap). If you're just walking from your car to work then straps would just be silly.The large hard front pocket at the top is rather nice for my essentials i don't want crushed (sun glasses, portable hdd, etc).Two side pockets are nice and zippers are easy to use with two hands, but with one hand you may just pull the backpack towards you instead of opening. That is actually a positive as i've had similar zippers get caught on stuff and open up the pocket without me knowing it. So the zippers don't get stuck, they are just a little tighter then say a normal zipper. I noticed another review complaining about the zipper being to tough. I guess if you want an easy open zipper, get a LLBean.The middle front pocket is not easily accessible, you'll need to undo the metal clips on right and left to reach the zipper (unless you don't close it all the way). This pockets is a pretty good size and has several compartments mounted inside for you to put your cell, etc.The front large compartment is 2 sections, laptop and other (book?). Great news is that the laptop section can be easily accessed without undoing the metal clips, unfolding the top pocket and then undoing the zipper. Oakley put a zipper on the side so you can easily slide your laptop/tablet in and out of the backpack (a great idea in my opinion as otherwise it would be too much trouble to undo everything every time i need to get my device for the day.The bottom pocket is great for wet clothes. It is made of waterproof material and extends into the 'other' pocket next to the laptop pocket (if you needed that extra space). The entire bottom pocket is isolated from the 'other' pocket with waterproof lining, so no worries about your stuff getting dirty. The bottom container also has drainage holes which again comes in handy when you have wet stuff/shoes in the bag.The bag is a little pricey at full price. Amazon had it for 169 when i was buying it and they had extra 20% off which i had trouble using until i contacted their customer support (total paid just under $133).Headphone port - the description mentions a headphone port, which i keep hoping will be an actual port to plug your headphones in... no such luck, the backpack has a slit on top of the hard pocket so you can slide your headphone wire through. A little concerned with how well that slit on top will do during rain. I think I may close that hole so that i don't have to worry about my stuff, placing your device into the backpack while hiking in my opinion is silly because you can't change the song, but that's another story.Overall the pack is very sturdy and looks great.Cons: A little pricey, but it's a rather nice pack so i think it's worth the money. It is the first backpack that has people asking about it and commenting on it. Not really the goal here, but it does look good.The top handle is my biggest gripe as it is a small thin metal handle. Not comfortable by a long shot if you had to lift the pack, especially if it is already loaded. The thin metal puts a bit of uncomfortable pressure to the hand the previous (Swiss) pack did not and since the hold for the hand is small too, then it's even harder to grab if you normally use this.Front pocket takes a few seconds to open up. So if you want quick access to that pocket, i suggest you look at other models. If the laptop pocket is enough for your quick access, then that is covered. That's all i needed, so i'm good.None of the gripes above were enough for me to take a star as they don't really effect me, but they may be things for you to consider before buying.\", 4443: \"I have been using this bag for almost 2 years, and it still looks as new as the day I got it!!!  And it can hold soooooo much stuff.  I bought it to carry my equipment on a mission trip.  It definitely protected my things well, even under some pretty lousy weather conditions.  I have even used this as a replacement for my 21&#34; wheeled carry-on--it holds just as much.  It easily accommodates a 17&#34; laptop.  It works great for everyday use, a weekend bag, or just going to the gym.  The side pockets are very generous and can hold full-sized shampoo/conditioner bottles with room to spare.  The bottom compartment can hold your shoes and/or sweaty gym clothes . . . and you won't fall over when you remember to take them out as it is ventilated.  The front-zip pocket with the accessory organizers is a little difficult to access quickly as you have to unclip the top flap, but I do like that the organizers are hard, so your electronic stuff won't be compromised by an overstuffed bag.  It is fairly pricey, but the quality is definitely there.  I would shop around to find the best price you can get.  A less manly version of this bag would be nice . . . although, I'm waaaaaayyy over it!!! ;)\", 4444: \"if you're looking for a bag that will handle the rigors of traveling, this is backpack to purchase. the quality of materials and workmanship are top notch, holds everything plus some. my bag usually has 2 laptops plus an ipad in the main compartment with room to spare. side pockets are bigger than they appear and the crush proof top pocket is great for a GPS unit. it's not cheap, but worth every penny and will pay for itself not having to replace cheaper backpacks every year. also get use to having people asking about it, it draws peoples attention\", 4445: \"This is an awesome backpack.

This backpack is awesome: plenty of pockets, lots of room, great clasps and it just looks cool!', 4448: 'This is a very good back pack - heavy duty, cool looking and many pockets to store different items.

Daily I bring a bag into a customer's facility, throw the bag in a car or an airplane compartment. This bag carries everything, and with room to spare. Tons of little pockets and compartments to store everything you need, from a portable HDD, a flashlight or some tools. The only thing it was missing was a ring to hang a quick release to store keys, which I quickly threaded on their. Problem solved!The rear side entry for quick laptop removal make it worth it alone if you fly with a bag. I haven't taken advantage of the wet clothing bag feature, but I can imagine this would work just as described.The hardened storage up top is great for your sunglasses so they don't get banged up. It stores so much I would actually caution you to try not to fill it, unless you have a very strong back.Awesome product.\", 4453: \"If you're looking for a awesome back-back that looks different and is a head turner than this is the back-pack for you. A lot of people wrote that the lid is a big issue but I found no problem with it. If you want it to stay back it will and how lazy are you away, it doesn't take that much effort/time to undo the latches. If you need to carry a lot this is a great purchase. I am overall very satisfied with this pack as I use it to travel, go camping, go skating, and go on hikes. It is about 4 pounds but, I like the weight, it make it feel heavy duty and well made.\", 4454: \"I love this bag.  Fast and prompt service with delivery.  It can be a little awkward getting into if you're in a hurry, but overall it's a very attractive bag, and I get lots of compliments on it.  And trust me.. This thing will hold the Kitchen Sink too !

When I saw it for the first time I was really disappointed with the size of the back pack. I think i should be listed as a women back pack. After returning the product.

This backpack is HUGE and looks good too!', 4464: \"I was looking for a bag that I could use for business as well as personal use. This thing is great. Its durable, well made, and has plenty of space. The only draw backs are the lack of a head phone port and the storage pouches in the 2nd largest pouch for pens etc. Are so rigid they don't grip anything well so those items sort of bounce around loose. Also the access to that pocket requires unlatching the larger flap.Still it holds my ipad, laptop, phones,  cables, notebooks, and a variety of other accessories with plenty of room to spare.\", 4465: \"I saw this backpack at the new Oakley store at the mall over the summer and fell in love with it for my son who's in the film industry and on location a lot shooting.  I knew this would be the perfect gift however the price was a little steep.  Thought I'd check Amazon for some better prices which I did.  Was able to save $50.00 on the purchase price.  Amazon gave me FREE shipping over Christmas so I avoided the mall and maintained my sanity.\", 4466: \"I have had this bag for almost a year and it is a workhorse. I have loaded almost 45 pounds on some days while traveling and it does not show any signs of wear and is very secure to walk around with since the zippers can be locked!

This one can handle any punishment it is thrown at it.\", 4468: \"I was VERY leery about paying this much for a backpack, I'm obsessed with backpacks and have way more than one person should have...but, I have to say this is one heck of a backpack!  I like the side zipper for the laptop compartment, my laptop and iPad fit with room to spare! When you open up the accessory compartment there are actually hard cased holders in there, perfect for mouse and power cords. The thing I really like is the fact there are a lot of different places to clip carabiner clips to hold sunglasses etc.... If you need a high quality good size back pack...this is it! Comfortable to wear and it also has a waist strap which I use to secure to my carry on when going through the airport.\", 4469: 'Bought this for my husband for christmas after seeing him looking into it. I watched youtube videos and reviews on it before making a decision. When I received it I knew why the price was more then a normal backpack. The Kitchen sink is built to last.

All round well built product would definitely recommend which I already have just showing people the backpack.', 4470: 'I bought this back about 2-3 months back to use getting back and forth to work on my motorcycle while carrying a large amount of gear with me.  This bag has met or exceeded all my expectations for it.  I usually carry 2 changes of clothes minus pants, work out gear, a shower bag, a change of shoes, and some misc paperwork.  The side pockets are great for rolling up clothes for quick access and the pouch on the bottom makes sure my dirty or wet clothes/shoes do not mess up my other clothes.  The laptop section is great for keeping my paperwork from getting messed up as I take things in and out of the bag.  The construction is solid and I do not anticipate any issues with tears or wearing in the near future.  I would definitely recommend this bag for people on the go that need to carry a lot of stuff.One negative comment.  The metal loops on the back of the bag make it difficult to store in smaller lockers when the bag is full.  Minor annoyance on an outstanding pack.', 4471: \"I got my kitchen sink pack from USstandardissue.com. I've had the pack now for about a month. Great pack I love the design. Would have given it 5 stars if it had an external pouch for a water bottle. I also wish the pouch on the shoulder strap were little bit larger ( big enough for a smartphone) . other than that it seems to be a very well built pack. I really like the rubber bottom. The shoulder straps and belt are great, very comfortable.  like the metal hooks and metal hoops seem to be overkill at first glance but I quickly found them to actually be kinda handy. Not to mention they do make the pack with really cool. I would definitely recommend this pack to a friend.\", 4472: 'We find that this backpack works very well for quick airplane travel.

The only draw backs are, it's a pain to get in and out of quickly and there aren't any inside compartments to help keep everything straight.\", 4474: \"When I first got the Kitchen Sink, I was skeptical about its ability to live up to its name. I later put a jacket, two pairs of running shoes, sweat pants, and miscellaneous electronic items in the main pocket. There was still room. This backpack has now replaced a small to medium sized duffel bag as well as the average size backpack it was intended to replace. That is to say that in the past I would use the backpack for certain things and the duffel for other separate things, this does both. It doesn't have the volume to replace both for instances where both would have previously been used simultaneously. I will be replacing a large duffel soon and an liking strongly at Oakley for that as well.\", 4475: 'This thing is amazing and its not what i expected my first thought was i might not like it and then would send it back but omg this looks amazing i need something to Carrie my new laptop and extra clothing/gear in it and this thing surpasses my military back but this is not for Heavy use but for urban use with so many compartment i add some para cord and other small survival and emergency gear but mainly my laptop you get what you pay for but material looks durable and the look and build is allot better', 4476: 'The storage is awesome!

Great looking, yet very versatile.  Great for traveling with electronics (iPad, iPhone, etc).  Rugged, comfortable.  Distributres weight very well.  Great for hiking or business trips!!', 4483: \"I bought this pack after another I had fell apart within a few months (a pack that costs as much as this one).. I went the extra mile and bought Oakley.  The biggest complaint you can have against their gear is the price.  It's not cheap, but it is VERY good.I'm thoroughly satisfied.\", 4484: 'I ordered this backpack from Amazon brand new. I love this backpack! Everything fits. There are many compartments. Unlike my old backpack, a Targus, everything gets strapped in with this backpack. My belongings are not flying around, which is better for my electronics. This backpack has individual places for a phone, wallet, pens, MP3 player, my lunch, a water bottle, a camera, umbrella, keys, my computer (18\" Alienware), and more. It\\'s waterproof (some areas) and sturdy. The metal, leather, and straps make this by far the sturdiest backpack I have owned. Finally, there are multiple straps. This was a little difficult to get just right, but I have it down now. Everything feels great for my 4 ten-minute walks through campus each day and when I travel. Oh, BTW, I get comments everymwhere I use this thing. People are pretty impressed when they see it, which I think is kinda\\' fantastic!', 4485: \"this bag is great such as all oakley products, great stuff!

I'll be traveling in style.\", 4491: 'Boyfriend loves this backpack. He has taken it with him whenever he travels and it has stood up great. It looks great and can hold EVERYTHING.', 4492: \"Thought the price was a little high but needed a backpack with lots of pockets.  This one has held up very, very well.  The only bad thing I can say is that it both large latches have to be released before you can access the main pocket for larger items.  Your laptop or tablet can be removed from the side zipper without opening the latches.  Oakley is a little too proud of their products but I'll have to say they did an awesome job designing this one.  Kudos.\", 4493: \"I ordered this for my husband's birthday and early Christmas gift. I am so happy I was able to find it cheaper then I had seen it elsewhere - paid the same for the backpack and shipping overseas as I had seen it in the shop a few months earlier. It arrived in only a few days and he was so surprised ! He had picked it out earlier so I knew it was just what he wanted - for traveling to work on his motorcycle.\", 4494: \"I didn't start out loving this backpack cause it's big and has all the hardware. But I travel A LOT and it is big enough to carry all the gear I need and especially to some of the rugged places I go to. And now after a one year of good hard use I love it. It's sturdy and as held up well. One of the pads on the bottom buckle came off but it's mostly just a cosmetic issue. Overall I'd recommend it if you need more space and something that will hold up under strong and sturdy use.\", 4495: 'Unreal how this backpack looks and performs.  it is meant for people to beat on it and it looks cool.  It also has a lots of places to store things. It has a sunglass case on the top that is reinforced for protection.  Nice', 4496: \"Initially, I had buyers remorse after purchasing this bag due to it's hefty price.  I considered canceling the order before it shipped and purchasing one of those Swiss laptop backpacks that I see all my fellow Metro Rail riders wear.  What kept me from following thru was that nagging feeling that I was just going to fit in with the herd and regret not going with my gut reaction after falling in love with the Kitchen Sink once I saw it on Amazon.Just received my package from Luggage Base (free shipping a plus) on Monday and everyone, including my neighbor who received it for me from the delivery guy was amazed.  We all were impressed by the sheer presence the bag has alone.  It definitely looks like a mans-mans kind of bag.  I began transferring all of my messenger bag contents into the Kitchen Sink to see if it was more form over function.Here is the break down of items: 2 text books and pad folio full of notes in the laptop section.  A large Stanley thermos (1.1 qt), a Zojirushi Classic Bento Vacuum Lunch Jar in the main compartment.  A 27oz L.L.Bean stainless steel water bottle in both side pockets.  All of my pens, markers, high liters and correction tape went in the front pocket.  My Gerber multi tool slid in perfectly into one of the rigid pockets inside as well as my portable digital storage devices.  The hard undershell top case holds my shades, of course, as well as my ear plugs for my iPhone.  I need to mention that every thing I stuffed into the bag still left me room for more.  I'm considering using the wet pocket that zippers open from the bottom for more water bottles since I try to stay hydrated enough to pee clear (sorry if TMI).Now to test out how comfortable it is to lug all this on my commute to/from work.  Let me first mention that I decided to remove the padded strap that goes around the waist.  Didn't feel comfortable having that thing dangling and the buckle clanging around.  The bag already draws enough attention.  It easily comes off by the Velcro attachment point behind the sleeve (you'll see).  Now on to the function part:  I take a rapid commuter bus with small aisles between the rows of seats.  Somehow I didn't need to take the pack off to walk down the aisle with both straps around my shoulders.  I take this bus to the Metro station and ride up one stop where I transfer to another line and ride that to the end of the line.  The verdict:  I love this bag!!! I barely feel the load because of the suspension system in the chest and shoulder strap combo.  I wonder how much better it would've been with the waist strap... I also love the attention the bag gets - even from other Oakley bag owners (Not Kitchen Sink).  I still haven't seen one yet on my commute during rush hour btw.  My only gripe is that you have to unclasp the cool hook thingys that secure the top flap in order to access the main compartment.  I only have to open it once when I get to work to unload my thermos and lunch container though since my pad folio and books are accessible through the side zipper.  Other than that I see why the Kitchen Sink is all that and then some.  Push 'Buy Now' and enjoy forever!\", 4497: 'Happy with it, only problem is that the bag itself is a bit heavy when its empty! But you can carry a lot and easy access to the laptop is great for the security checks at airports.', 4498: 'The person I gave it to as a gift love it. It was what I expected ..price was awesome . At the store is way more expensive', 4499: \"I bought this Backpack for my trips to the beach and it met all my requirements. It's classy, spacious, comfortable and resistant.\", 4500: \"I'm in the US Military (Infantry) so I've used assault packs and know what I like in them. I wasn't expecting a backpack that was purely functional and tough, but wanted something that I would still be able to take out backpacking, travel, general use, etc. I have yet to put serious usage in mine (and probably won't after getting it), but I can already tell you the issues with it...Despite what people say about quality, the quality of this bag is only decent. This thing will not endure serious heavy usage, you can't hump up a 14er with 35lbs of junk, throw it to the ground upon arriving to the summit, proceed to sit on it and have lunch, it's just not that kinda bag. Some of the features on this backpack are basically rendered useless because of the inability to endure serious stress. The 3 brackets on the back...why? The plastic plate that acts as a base plate for them isn't strong enough to support much secured weight, thus there's not much point to it. What are they for anyways? Are we hanging pots and pans from our backpacks now? I may just manually take the brackets off and sew on a velcro patch to cover the area. The velcro straps on the sides that act as fasteners..again, why? The pockets are small enough that if anything is in them the velcro straps aren't really further securing them. Maybe if you were planning on carrying around tiny kittens or puppies in those pockets and you didn't want them to jump out. They should be more designed for water bottles. If you think they're for externally securing equipment I'll tell you now that the straps aren't heavy duty enough for that. The metal carrying handle is beyond unnecessary, it's no stronger than a strap and adds dead weight. And finally perhaps the biggest useless feature is the waist belt. This bag isn't going to be carrying around enough weight that a belt would do any good, besides that, who uses those with backpacks? I'm contemplating just cutting off the waist belt if it doesn't hurt the integrity of the bag. If you're using waist belts for anything other than a rucksack then you're a creep.Alright, those are my biggest cons. So I'll name off my pros...The bag looks good, it wears well (on me), and is good for civilian use. For general usage purposes this is good quality, but as I said, this is not your pack if you're looking for heavy duty usage. I notice a lot of people talk about the excellent quality of this backpack, I can only assume this bag is being used for general purposes by most. The details are nice on the bag, the hooks and zipper handles are totally pointless, but they look quality. For traveling this bag is great, I have compartment that keep my electronics and sensitive items hidden away. Despite what people say about the second pocket being hard to access underneath the large flap -- I like this, it allows me to put my IDs, money, electronics in a compartment that I know is hard for thieves to access. If I'm standing somewhere crowded with my bag on my back I always feel a little weary that someone could unzip a pocket and search around. The bag has a good deal of room for stuffing. When I travel overseas I like to pack light, this bag allows me to have a carry on where I can fit a good amount of clothes in. It has a laptop pocket with side access, that's very convenient, I hate opening up a bag and unpacking a layer to pull my laptop/ipad out. The bottom of the backpack has a compartment that is unzippable and sealed off from the rest of the interior, I personally like to put my shoes in this pocket because I don't have to worry about sand and dirt getting everywhere on the inside, in my clothes, electronics, whatever else. The top compartment for sunglasses is perhaps a little overblown, but it is nice to have a little compartment for delicate items and quick access to personal belongings. I can imagine that over time this hardened foam compartment will likely collapse, time will tell.Overall this bag is overpriced at $200 (I paid half price from Oakley) for what it functions as. I would say it's 75% fashion and 25% function. But if you're using this as a general usage backpack then I'm sure you're okay with it. It looks good, the ladies (and possibly some dudes) will comment on what a faux bad-ass you look like. Now that you've read my review you can revel in the knowledge that this backpack is not a serious heavy duty backpack but will make you seem like a cool guy to the casual person who has no idea of quality. With that said I will be using this backpack, just don't take yourself too seriously with it in public.\", 4501: 'I love this back pack. no matter when I go I get stopped and asked when I got it . the price on here was the cheapest ive found the even beat the Oakley outlet store.', 4502: 'This backpack is AWESOME!  If you are a big guy (I am 6\\'3, 275lbs) this is the backpack for you, no more looking like you have a child\\'s bag on your back.  I always have the same problems with backpacks, the shoulder straps are extended to the end and the darn thing is still sitting up way too high, that is NOT the case with this pack,  I cannot actually extend the straps to their limit, the pack would be so loose it would fall off my back.  This pack is cavernous!  I am able to have my laptop, binders, full change of clothes (including shoes) shaving bag, IPAD, headphones and other normal items (notebooks, pens, USB hard drive) and STILL have room to put my jacket in the bag without even coming close to the \"full\" capacity of this bag.  As far as durability I think this bag will last, all zippers are VERY heavy duty and the clasps that hold the main compartment closed are strong enough to tow a truck.  Almost every compartment could be locked if desired as each of the zippers have aircraft cable rings on the end that could be used for a padlock.  I have made a few trips with the bag so far and at this point I have zero complaints, it does everything advertised and holds more than most carry-on bags.... SATISFIED CUSTOMER', 4503: 'It is clearly a very sturdy design, but maybe a little over-engineered for aesthetic reasons. The grab handles or rings on the back are a good example of this. However it is overall a well constructed bag that is lighter than it looks. My biggest issue would be the waist-band: It has an aluminium buckle through which you adjust length ... that attaches to a flimsy strip of velcro that folds back onto itself. This is probably the first thing I would improve if I modify it in the near future, and something I would expect to be better designed for the price.', 4504: 'hello siri made the order as it is but just to make shore that the color is the same as the photo. combletly blake with silver hangers and lockers. not the gray one nither the combletly blake.thanks', 4505: 'I bought this for my college-aged son and he totally loves it. Bear in mind that it has a great deal of metal on it so to me it is very heavy. My son could not be happier though.', 4506: 'I am completely satisfied with the product.great backpack!!! I hope it is as durable as to be apparent. I do not hesitate to buy again at amazon', 4507: \"This was a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it. The shoe compartment on the bottom is so nice to keep the rest of the items in the bag clean. The laptop storage section is super convenient and protects the computer well. There is a reason this bag is called the kitchen sink. Definitely fits a lot of items. I chose this bag with the silver clasps, etc, cause I felt that the black paint on them would rub/scratch off with time. We've now had this bag for a couple years and it has definitely held up without problems with numerous numerous trips. Definitely recommend this product.\", 4508: 'Was a little hesitant on making this buy, but quality is top of the line. Expect to own/use this product for a while...', 4509: 'This bag has been my everything since I received it months ago. I have taken it to China, South America and numerous business trips. The laptop access is fantastic and the bottom pouch allows me to bring shoes or put dirty clothes (i.e. gym clothes) away separately without ruining the space of the main compartment. The numerous nooks and crannies found in this bag provide an amazing number of options for storage. I am still finding a daily use for the metal bars on the pack, but if nothing else, they have been good for starting conversations! Great buy!', 4510: 'I really like this back pack, the functionality and good looks made it a must for me. The company shipped on time,( early even) and the only problem I saw was that there is no place for an external water bottle. Given the name I assumed it would be great for everything plus... But all in all I like my backpack.', 4511: 'This is a backpack for someone with a lot of stuff , I honestly think it may be too large for school however I like being able to keep my lunch in it as well as my books , laptop , binder , headphones , DS , kindle etc so if you like to have all your gear with you , buy this bag , but if you only have a small amount of stuff you carry with you i would recommend a lighter bag.', 4512: \"I get a lot of compliments on this bag, not only does it look good it performs really good. I put things such as a basketball and I could fit 3 waters, 16.9 OZ on either side of the inside pocket.05/26/13 UpdateI still think this bag rocks, I was able to fit 2 adult size basketballs the other day, it was tight though but it was able to clip it shut. The best part about this bag is the main compartment size and how it locks down with just those 2 front clips. I also enjoy how much stuff I could put in the side pockets since I like to pack a lot of fluids for my day. I also enjoy the waist strap and the chest strap because I usually have to walk about 2 blocks from where I park and sometimes I'm running and this bag does a great job with keeping it securely on my back. I don't use the front pockets very often since its hard to get stuff out of when you have the bag full because the pocket gets really tight. I only use the front pockets for things I rarely use such as for medications. The side pockets are not effected by what is in the main compartment and its really easy to get things in and out. I also don't use the Velcro that's on the side pockets. People like to grab the metal loops at times for fun but whatever its a great bag and its very durable.\", 4513: 'Been using for over a year now and still looks new. Very rugged and plenty of pocket and protection for your laptop. Caution it is heavy even empty. Still it looks tough.', 4514: 'Of course we are not talking about the cheaper one avaiable, but Oakley Kitchen Sink Backpack is a great choice for people that wants to have a tough and durable backpack. I recommend!', 4515: 'Great Bag. Does not have as much room as I would like, but it works great as a laptop/tech bag. Lots of room on the sides for a big Nalgene water bottle or food, hard cover glasses case works well at protecting tech (phones, ipods, etc), side zipper to reach into the padded laptop sleeve is very convenient, hooks to attach things with a carabiner is very nice, I really like the steel clips to hold the top in place, very sturdy bag so far!', 4516: 'Oakley quality all over this bag! Everywhere I go with it I get compliments on how nice it looks. Has served me well, and looks like it will be there for the long haul', 4517: 'Wow, this is a nice case, I was afraid it was going to be too big, but not the case, its just perfect. It is massive in appearance & definitely masculine. The seller delivered it strait to my door in two days & did not charge me shipping nor taxes.  The price was great, the bag is beautiful & is made of great quality.  The delivery was above & beyond the call of duty.  It was packaged & protected well.  Love the seller.  Hats off to them.', 4518: \"I have this bag for a year now and I work for the railroad so most bags don't last 6 months this one is still in great condition,,looks like I can get a few more years out of it,,one down side to it is I wish it would expand more,other wise it is a awesome bag.\", 4519: \"I have an Oakley Icon 3.0, and have loved it for years. I always admired the Kitchen Sink, as it is a stylish and functional bag. When I finally got around to buying one in the Stealth Black colour, it was love from first sight.This bag will fit absolutely anything you need to put in it, and carries it with style. At no point have I ever felt that this bag would break with too much weight in it, as all of the seams and critical connection points are extremely secure. There are so many pockets and options of how to use it that the possibilities are endless!Oakley has thought of everything with this bag. From the three metal hooks to put carabiners, the waterproof pocket on the bottom for gym shoes, towels, or bathing suits, the felt-lined sunglass pocket at the top with a hard outer for protection, to the two large clamps that have two ways of opening; press the inside or pull the outside to open the clasps. The option to remove the waist cushion if you don't need it, with easy velcro, is a welcome addition to the bag's multipurpose uses.Wearing this bag around campus and the city, I have gotten compliments and people asking me where I got it. All of these comments from others I get in comfort and style, and this is what I love about the Kitchen Sink. All in all, this bag has a sleek unique urban look, and you can use it knowing it has your back while comfortably on yours.\", 4520: 'I have been using this pack everyday for about the last six weeks, and it has been working like a boss.  I\\'ve got my 17\" widescreen laptop, several books, laptop charger and wireless mouse, some DVD\\'s, raincoat in the bottom \"shoe pouch\" and a spare pair of shades in the top \"hard pouch\".  For everyday use, I have removed the bottom kidney strap as it just gets in the way for the short treks from the car to the house to work again, but may put it back on if a long journey ensues.Anyone who has a lot to carry with them on a daily basis should get this pack, and never have to worry about running out of room again.', 4521: 'Tons of space and tough. Would expect no less from oakley. Airport friendly. Easy to get laptop out at TSA checkpoint', 4522: \"I bought this bag for my bf & he LOVES it!! It's well made & very roomy!Arrived on time as well.\", 4523: 'My job requires me to move from one office setting to another frequently throughout the week.  I researched this bag a ton online and wanted to actually see it in person before buying.  I did and then promptly purchased it.  I have had this bag now for about a month and love it!  I wanted something that I could use for work (looked professional & carried what I needed) but also could use for travel.  This works great for me to pack weekend trips in.  My family does a lot of weekend travel and I have used this with great success.', 4524: \"This is amazing!!! plain and simple, you want a real bag get this. its heavy so just don't be a sissy\", 4525: 'Oakley generally makes great products. This product however proved to be a little bulkier and heavier than expected. It does not fit easily in overhead compartments on most planes. In hindsight I would have bought the smaller version bathroom sink had I known. It is great for technical hikers but compartments are not as easily accessed as advertised. It did freak out one elderly passenger as she thought I was boarding plane with a parachute on !! I would have graded this 3 1/2 starts if possible not 4.', 4526: 'I love this back pack really good. The materials and design on this back pack is awesome.  I totally recomend this back pack to anyone.', 4527: \"I don't know about most people, but my kitchen sink is big! LOL I wish it was more compartmentalized. It's just open areas and your stuff gets scattered.\", 4528: \"Well Oakley has done it again with another great product. When I first seen it I thought it wouldn't be worth it for the amount of money I had to fork over but I decided to just wing it and buy it. So far it has held up extremely well for me and being military you try to keep an eye out for quality gear, and I guess my luck won.Pros:high quality materialsquite breathable on your backcan except a hydration bladder (just use the laptop pocket)has more than enough room for a bug out bag (probably about 3 days worth of supplies)has molie webbing on the beltspot to put your wet clothes to separate them from other things you might havehead phone port (radio port for you military guys)makes people stare and ask where you got itperfect bag for the range, mountain biking, climbing and just about any other thing you could use a back pack forcons:costno velcro for a name tape or patcheswish the chest and waist buckles were metalno rain coverno drainage holesI seen this bag in a movie too its in Terminator Salvation near the end just a random fact :)\", 4529: \"After paying the money for this bag I hate to say that it is really not anymore functional than your average school backpack. Sad to say you are essentially paying for the brand and &#34;cool factor&#34; of this bag. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice travel bag and will serve you very well. If you're going to get it though just try to find it for the best price you can. It looks awesome and works well for holding stuff.Awesomeness can sure be pricey though :)\", 4530: \"The only thing missing is the kitchen sink. Sweet bag. No exaggeration. A little bit big, but I'm not taking a star off for that. Maybe the bathroom sink is a good fit if you don't need a super large bag like this. Convenient pockets/ functionalality great inner liner, exterior very durable, quick access pockets, interior organizer. All very cool. Laptop accessibility pocket is great. Traveled with it. No one said anything at the airports, security or inside the plane. Great bag. A must have.\", 4531: 'Pros:I had been looking for a replacement bag to replace a High Sierra backpack I have owned and used almost every day for the past 7+ years. I read all the reviews on this bag and I am glad I went with it. It has a heavy gauge construction exterior and the zippers, snaps and buckles are of excellent quality, I should get many years of service from this backpack. It has a ton of room inside and lots of extra pockets to hold all your favorite gadgets including a padded laptop section. I have personally had over 50lbs. in the pack and it was still comfortable to carry. The straps are wide and padded for your comfort. There are several adjustable straps that allow you to tailor fit this bag to your body type. All I can say is \"Awesome\" glad I went with this.Now the Cons:A little bit pricey, but after you get it you will see why. Top notch materials and craftsmanship. This bag should easily outlast my last one.The hard storage pocket in the top flap of the bag is a little heavier material and has a tendency to make the bag fall over when it is less than 1/3 full. What I did is make a wire cage frame inside the bag out of 1/8\" steel rod (Purchased at Lowes for less than $10)  that went from corner to corner and around the top flap on the inside of the bag and now it stand completely upright just like the picture shows, even when its completely empty. I think they should take my idea and incorporate it inside the bag. The cage didn\\'t even add 1/2 lb. to the total weight and it in no way hindered the bags performance, in fact it looks like it belongs there. I was able to tuck it in the creases; it\\'s almost invisible unless you really look for it.All in all I love it!!!!!!!!', 4532: \"This is a fairly expensive bag, but well worth it.  It has plenty of storage, a comfortable fit, and seems very durable.  I have a Oakley laptop bag as well (not the backpack) that pretty much matches this.  I've had it for about 2 years with constant use and abuse and it still looks brand new.  The backpack is made out of the same material with the same stitching.I am please with this.\", 4533: 'As anyone who owns an ASUS gaming laptop can tell you, it is hard to find a backpack that can actually hold the thing.  This bag works well with room to spare.  The construction also seems to be quite durable, so longevity should not be a problem.  I would recommend this bag to anyone willing to spend this kind of money on a backpack and who needs to carry a large laptop.', 4534: 'I got this bag and had hesitations because it was a bit pricy BUT it has to be the best product i have bought in the 5 years i have been shopping on amazon! Great material! clips make it look great and it has side pouch for laptop. THIS IS AN UNIVERSAL BAG. fits LOTS of stuff, holds strong and defiantly worth the price', 4535: 'I LOVE THIS BAG! I purchased it for a 10 day motorcycle trip, and it was amazingly functional. All the hardware is very sturdy, not cheap or flimsy at all, and was great to strap the bag to the bike. The fact that you can pack from the top of the bag as well as the bottom makes it awesome for separating dirty laundry from clean stuff. The hard pocket on the top of the bag is great for sunglasses ect. Its a little heavy/bulky for daily use, but this backpack is perfect for a short trip! Im very satisfied!', 4536: 'Im on the move pretty much all the time, work, home, gf house, ext and needed a bag to carry around a complete 2 days worth of clothes. one backpack I had was to small, and a duffle was way to big. so I tried this one out. I have a change of work clothes, change of regular clothes, gym shorts, shower bag, cooks knife roll set, cell phone charger, lap top and charging cable, ipod, headphones. and still have room to spare. once loaded done, youll be thankful for the metal handle on top. weights about a metric ton but once seated the shoulders and adjusted right, its not to bad. overall, great 48 hour bag.', 4537: 'I love this backpack. It can fit my laptop and my ipad with no issues. I use this as a carry on so on top of all that I am able to fit about 2 days of clothes in here as well. Pleanty of pockets and the protector on the top for your sunglasses is pretty cool.', 4538: \"over all not bad. the look is great. very heavy duty. the individual pockets are really handy.i'm just a little disappointed to see such a big pack but can't hold as much. not as much as i thought at least.also for a pack size as such i can use a pair of much wider and more supportive straps, since the latest designs are.the back support is fine most of the time, till i pack the full load.\", 4539: \"Great bag. I had the worn olive OP pack but didn't like the way the latches worked. This one is way better! Looks cooler too.\", 4540: \"Beautiful, Came right on time. One thing though, I ordered an XL, and he usually wears a Large, it fit perfectly. But the sizes do run small. if it would have been for me I would have had to get a XXX-L. I'm glad I ordered it one size larger.\", 4541: \"This is perfect for carry on luggage. I love the 50/50 split and zippered compartments  that keep everything organized.Update, I've had this bag a full year now. It's survived 4 flights as carry on or checked with the airline, and many road trips.Still looks new, no problems whatsoever. I'm looking to upgrade to a larger model to check so I  can pack my pillow inside easily.nothing against this model, you can fit a lot inside it.\", 4542: 'I love this messenger bag.  My previous one was stolen so I had to get me another one.  The best one I have ever owned.', 4543: \"I bought this bag for times when I just need to bring my laptop to/from work or just a folder or two.  You can't cram this full of accessories, but it does hold a laptop, paperwork and a charger.  It's not going to protect your laptop if a car runs over it, but it's plenty sturdy for everyday commuting.  I like that it's a vertical design rather than horizontal.\", 4544: 'practical, great design fits all my needs, it only lacks a bottle caring net!beside that every thing it is great!', 4545: 'I am realy happy with my product the seler is very good and responsible I would buy tu him again', 4546: 'I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. And I really like it myself and my order one later.', 4547: \"This bag is great! It functionality is superb!  The only problem I have with it is the 'Men's' in the description of the bag; because I am a woman and it works just fine for me too!\", 4548: 'Very durable and Correct Description.', 4549: 'My husband loves this bag.  It very practical for the work he does and it has amazing durability.  Love it!', 4550: 'I got this at the oakley store in vegas. I use it every day to cary a notebook macbook air google nexus. I am a huge bag person and think this one i will keep and use for a long long time.', 4551: \"My friend already had one. This is why I bought this one.  I already liked the features.  The price was HALF of what my friend paid!  The bag came quickly and was packed perfectly.  The quality is excellent. This is not a bag that is going to wear out fast.  I'm going to use it for my new Macbook Air!  The internal pouch is perfect for it.  This bag is my &#34;man's purse&#34; for sure.\", 4552: \"This bag is the most practical item I've ever purchased! It has so many places to put all the stuff I need and the size is perfect. Oakley as always does my favorite stuff!!\", 4553: \"The bag is a very good quality and it looks very nice, the only thing is that there isn't much protection for your computer. I'm looking for a sleeve that i will put in the bag for some extra padding.\", 4554: \"I've had this bag for about a week now. I wanted a little time to pass to make sure I liked it as much as I thought I did before I wrote this review. With every passing day, I like it more & more ... so I guess the time to give this product five stars is now.Obviously I haven't had it long enough to evaluate how well it will hold up; but I honestly don't see anything about its construction that would make me doubt that it will perform as well as any other bag. I treat all my belongings with respect; and I expect to do the same with this messenger bag ... so I don't anticipate any problems in that regard.There's something about a vertical messenger bag that just works better for me. Perhaps it's my body type; but horizontal messenger bags feel like I'm carrying luggage over my shoulder. I used to carry a backpack; but nothing is ever accessible when you really need it. This vertical messenger bag feels like I'm carrying just the right size personal accessory and every single item I need is secure but at hand behind one of its many zippers.The bag is loaded with pockets and ways to organize items. I am able to put my 13&#34; MacBook & iPad in the double rear compartment with plenty of room to spare. I store my wallet & iPhone in the small lower pocket at the front for easy access; and there are numerous other pockets for every other item I routinely carry. There's a key holder & three pen holders. (Unlike a previous reviewer, I have not had a single pen, stylus, etc fall from the clips.When I really, really love something, I am always afraid I will be without it someday ... so on rare occasions, I order a backup just in case the item I love goes out of production. Perhaps the highest compliment I can give this bag is that I've already ordered its backup!\", 4555: 'I\\'m very happy with this messenger bag, it has enough space to carry my everyday stuff, which equal a 13\" laptop, a book, a note pad an my shades.The design is practical and comfortable, the only flaws I perceive are the side compartments which are useless and I would like to have a more cushioned pad for the shoulder strip, just as the handle which is great.The construction is solid, the zippers are not as great as other Oakley bags I own, but the work.I recommend the product.', 4556: 'First of all, let me get out the way why I gave it a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating. The product\\'s description says it will fit up to a 15\" laptop. This is true.... however it\\'s a VERY tight fit. I have a Toshiba 15\" laptop and it\\'s TIGHT! This could cause strain on the zippers over time because it\\'s very snug! Also, my 15\" laptop will NOT fit into the laptop section of this bag [the section with the velcro strap]. It\\'s just TOO tight. It fits into the section right next to that. For those who have a smaller than 15\" laptop or a small tablet, this is PERFECT!!! The positive of this snug fit is that it\\'s VERY secure where it is, with next to no play whatsoever. I\\'m guessing it will \"give\" a little over time, so we\\'ll see. Apart from that small glitch, it\\'s a BRILLIANT product in just about every way. VERY well contructed all round, has amples of storage compartments and is VERY comfortable in the strap over the head/shoulder carry position; and it looks AWESOME! A real eye-catcher! I highly recommend this product.... apart from the small glitch mentioned eaarlier. As usual, Amazon\\'s customer service was top-notch. Buy it.... you will not regret it!', 4557: 'this is a great looking case bag. it fit perfect with my 15 in laptop. the pocket come in diffrent sizes. feel good around my neck. wow i love this bag..', 4558: 'I had the previous design of this bag as well and used it to bring to work and travel around the world for many years.  The pouches have been re-designed, neither for the better or worse, and it will even fit my 17 inch WS lapatop', 4559: \"I just purchased this for my husband for Father's Day. It has not been used yet, so I will have topost another review after he uses it. But as far as the unboxing goes, its lightweight yet sturdy. It has many pockets zippers padding, bells and whistles.Thank you.\", 4560: \"Love Oakleys. They make great lenses. Although, on this model in particular, the lenses are not dark enough for my taste. Next time I'll spring for the polarized or the iridium. But for the price these shades rock!\", 4561: \"these oakleys are sweet, they're bigger than gascans, so i wouldnt recommend if u have a small head, perfect for me though....price was silly cheap too(65.00), must have for oakley fans......\", 4562: 'It still last. This item i purchase back in 2011 or 2012 and it still has a perfect frame. Great.', 4563: \"best set of sunglasses ever. i have a large head and fit is perfect. quality of lenses couldn't be better\", 4564: \"So I've been wanting a pair of Oakley's for awhile now and this past weekend I finally had a chance to pick up the Oakley Ten Polarized.  First of all, these are quality built shades!  Secondly they are made in America!!  I got the Black Iridium Polarized lenses and they are crystal clear.  The frames are durable and fit well.  In just a week I've had more compliments on these shades than any others that I've worn in the past, usually VZ or something similar from the local surf shops.  Let me tell you this, I'll never go back to anything but Oakley.  The lenses on the Ten's can be changed out as well, so for different conditions or a scratched lens I'm covered.  You won't go wrong with these.\", 4565: 'These are Oakley so you know its quality. but the the lense is too large at least for me. I dont like it when the glasses sit or touch my cheeks. They start to get sweaty and I constantly have to wipe them and move them off my cheeks by placing them lower on my nose.', 4566: 'I love these sunglasses, I take it everywhere I Go. Oakley Brands are the Best and they will not disappoint! Oakley tens fit my face because I have a BIG HEAAD and these shades are enough to fill the need!', 4567: 'They hurt my ears a little bit. I usually have problems finding glasses that fit correctly. But overall a really good pair of sunglasses. I would recommend them.', 4568: 'I bought these for my husband. He already had a pair of Oakley Tens so these were not a big jump from what he was wearing. They were a different color and that was it. They are great sunglasses and I am glad I found them. They have a wide fit but if you have wider or rounder head they may just be the perfect fit.', 4569: 'The sunglasses fit well and is a great design!  The item arrived with the quickness! The red lenses seem to be harder to clean for whatever reason! Overall I am happy with the purchase!', 4570: 'I have been a Oakley fanatic for decades - since I could shop on my own and I grew up were they have an Oakley Outlet but this was a better deal than I could find. Love them', 4571: \"I love Oakley sunglasses and these don't disappoint.  Being on sale for under $100 helps, too.  Fits perfectly.  I recommend these.\", 4572: 'I love Oakleys.  Maybe it is because I grew up in the eighties when these glasses became popular and had a big \"cool\" factor.  I have owned several pairs.  I have tried several brands of sunglasses.  Oakleys are my favorite.  To me, Oakley lenses are the best.  The clarity and tint they provide is superior to all other brands I have tried.  My wife agrees.  She prefers Oakleys and owns a few pairs as well.  For outdoor sports and style, they are hard to beat.My favorite Oakley model to date is the Ten series.  I prefer glasses that the frame encloses the entire lens.  This protects the lens better and makes the glasses more durable.  I have owned models where the bottom of the lens is exposed outside the frame.  This seems to make the lense more likely to get damaged.  The Tens enclose the entire lens.  I have a large face and head, and this model fits me perfectly.  The straight arms makes for a better fit and don\\'t rub the back of your ears.  They are comfortable and fit securely.  The lenses are replacaeble and Oakley has a large selection of different lens colors and tints available.  This is good because the lenses normally become scratched or damaged before the frames do.  You can replace or customize the lenses without buying an entire new pair.  These cover your entire eyes well.  Oakleys are also made in the USA.  This is not easy to find anymore.  These glasses look good, are durable, have superior optics, are comfortable, and perfect for any outdoor activity and sport.', 4573: 'Ultra light and good protection.I am wearing it everyday but also for my exercising activities.I can highly recommend it to', 4574: \"I was surprised at how good these look.  I'm sometimes a bit hesitant of buying certain Oakley glasses because they tend to look like Batman goggles, and I couldn't quite tell from the photo which way these would go, but they are fairly &#34;normal&#34; looking, but with a little flair of style.  I got them for my brother who loves the Oakley futuristic look, but I liked them so much, I may buy a pair for myself.  I did get these on a really good sale though... not sure if I'd be willing to pay MSRP on them.  They fit nicely on larger faces like mine, but don't look weird on medium faces either.  The lenses aren't polarized, but do have a good shape that allow for a wide field of view (no blind spots created by the sides of the frames).  There are a couple companies out there that sell really nice polarized lenses for these for very inexpensive... could be a good combo if you like pola sunglasses.\", 4575: \"I'm half Asian/half white and I got blessed/cursed with a large noggin (I wear a 7.5 to a 7.75 cap) and a wide face.  I've always struggled to find activewear sunglasses that fit, and stumbled upon these glasses after a good bit of Internet searching.These aren't quite wrap around shades, but they feel like it (this is a good thing) as it keeps sunlight from creeping in.  Whether its driving to/from work, going for a run, playing baseball, etc, I wear these constantly.I've generally been very averse to buying &#34;expensive&#34; sunglasses, but at $90 I've found myself really taking care of them, especially because of the fit reasons.  Eventually would like to replace the stock lenses with polarized ones, but right now just enjoying the heck out of the shades.  Highly recommend.\", 4576: 'Its an Oakley.

Thanks guys!\", 4578: 'Batwolf shades are cool looking, big-coverage sunglasses.  They are dark and work well to dim down a bright day.  I haven\\'t worn them lately because I got a pair of prescription Oakley Gascans that are polarized as well as corrective.  The art on the Batwolf carry bag is great. If you have never seen a Batwolf, go to the Oakley site! The assorted snap-in O icons are kind of fun.  The shape of the lens area is a bit \"evil\" and I like that.  Black Iridium hides my eyes completely; useful for looking longer than I should!  They will be worn this the summer if the sun ever comes out again over Chicagoland.', 4579: \"Beautiful sunglesses!

If you have a larger face like I do they may be tight around your cheeks.', 4582: 'I love my new glasses, bought them for exactly 100 hundred dollars less than at Oakley store.  Comfortable and durable', 4583: 'Love these glasses!  They look great and function extremely well.  The wrap around is perfect for when I am out on a long bike ride as it keeps all wind out of your eyes and gives you great coverage from the sun.  Only reason I didnt give it a 5 star review is because it pinches a bit on my nose, which could be just more about the shape of my face than anything else.  For the price its a sold and great looking product.', 4584: 'I love sunglasses, and have always liked the Oakley brand.  In batwolf, I have found a pair that truly fit my large face, and feel very comfortable as well.  What I really like about this model is that in addition to being able to swap lenses, they have Oakley logos which are swapable...and you get a spare set right in the box when you buy \\'em. Additionally, you can buy other colors for the Oakley O logo online so if colors are important to you, the possibilities are endless.  If you ride a bicycle or motorcyle as I do, you\\'ll find that these are ideal for keeping the wind out of your eyes.On the con side, the glasses are too big to fit the various Oakley cases that I own.  The spare \"O\" logos are outrageiously expensive ($12.00/set) which is alot for two tiny pieces of plastic. As of this review, there are very few spare lens choices available from Oakley and very limited frame colors too.  I\\'m hoping that will change soon.', 4585: 'I really love these glasses. They come with 2 additional icons that you can switch out on the sides and look pretty cool as well. I used to wear Spy Haymakers which have a similar look but I really enjoy these a lot more. I will be buying another pair in a different color for sure!', 4586: 'Sweet and sweet is. Brown is a nice look. Be a badass with these sunglasses. Live great, eat good, peace', 4587: 'I love these glasses.  They are the perfect fit.  I did change out the lenses for a darker pair, but they are awesome!', 4588: 'It is the second time I buy it and it really fits me pretty well.I was stolen a couple of months ago and decided to buy it again.Definitely, it is amazing.', 4589: \"These are great glasses if you are looking for bigger lenses than those in models like the flak jacket. I had the Hijinx and really liked them for a sporty/casual plastic frame, but I lost them a couple months ago. These look really good and fit very well. They are not as heavy up front as the Hijinx, so they don't leave creases quite as deep on the bridge of your nose. These are super comfortable plastic frames. Get the Non-Polarized and save the money.\", 4590: 'Oakley is the product to buy if your a electrician or just a consumer i am so glad that they are dedicated to providing me with a good product', 4591: 'just a heads up for those considering buying this particular model.  These are NOT polarized but overall great sunglasses for the price.', 4592: 'great coverage, love the color, lenses are not too dark and not too light, lense color seems to make images crisper looking.

My husband has been a long-time Oakley fan, so he was very pleased to find out that I bought myself a pair (my first pair).  They're great!  I wear them almost every day.  Also, they come with two great options for cases.  One cloth and one hard case.  Both of which work well.  I would definitely recommend these.\", 4595: 'Great sunglasses. Good look, great fit.

I would recommend for regular use, not for hiking or running.', 4599: \"While I loved the look and feel of these glasses, they fit too close to my face to wear them while running in a humid environment.  They just fogged up until I took them off.  Probably fantastic for everyday wear, but I'm looking specifically for something I can run in.\", 4600: \"I love Oakleys and have worn them for many years since my son bought me a pair for my birthday.Can't wear anything else since! I'm spoiled by the quality!\", 4601: 'I love these sunglasses!! Very good quality and they fit my face very well!!! These sunglasses will definitely keep out the sun!!

After my last pair of cheapo sunglasses broke, I ordered three different styles of sunglasses from Amazon, and these were my choice to keep. They have great coverage and are dark enough without making everything completely black. The clarity is amazing to me. The style is great--large, which looks fashionable, but not so large that you look like you have fly eyes. It\\'s a nice bonus that they come with a cool case. And, if this is the sort of thing that\\'s important to you--they\\'re MADE in the USA! How many times can you say that? I ordered the \"Amethyst\" color, which I was concerned might be really purple based on the name--more than it appears in the photo. But, they are more on the brown side, and represented well by the picture. Order them! You won\\'t regret it!', 4603: 'Being a long time Oakley fan, I bought this sunglasses for my wife and she just adored it. Aside from being stylish my wife commented that the fit was perfect and was light weight.', 4604: \"I got these glasses to run in.  They work well on my small face and stay in place easily while running.  The only thing I'd change is adding some rubber to the ends for comfort.  Great glasses!\", 4605: 'Good and stylish. If thick rims are your things then these are the ones for you.  I only give four stars because they attract dust very easily and feel very flimsy but are durable enough for me.  They are good for the out doors hiking and camping. You will be hard pressed to find this quality at this price.', 4606: 'Excellent Sunglasses! The Prime Quality! I am Very Happy with my product! Congratulations, Oakley! Oakley is the best of brand!', 4607: 'Came in the mail quickly and looks better in person and they even came with a second set of interchangeable icons. Also came with a microfiber bag that doubles as a cleaning cloth with a pocket for spare oakley icons. I got the clear frame/ ice iridium lenses and they look awesome! If their are negative reviews then ignore them these are a great product.', 4608: \"I bought the glasses for my son. We had seen them at the mall for $50 more. The ones purchased through Amazon had a nicer case than what the glass store had to offer. I'm not big on sun glasses, but my teen boy loves them.\", 4609: \"I've used Oakley for years now and this pair of Oakley is as expected (awesome). I'm sure there are better makes and models, but for the price, it's fantastic. $99Might not be right for all Asian people, so make sure you try it out first before buying. Oakley has 2 lines of the same model, Asian fit and none Asian fit (not joking).\", 4610: 'Like them a lot! Style is awesome. Just be sure to try them on somewhere before you buy because of the size.', 4611: 'Spot on with the glasses! My husband couldnt be happier, and we got exactly what we ordered. i couldnt ask for more.', 4612: 'They were just what I was expecting :) oakleys are always the best!! These look even better on. Would def recommend', 4613: 'Bought as a gift for my nephew working as a lifeguard.

I got the polished black with purple plaid icons. I really like these shades. Worth every penny. Comfortable and stylish shades. I would recommend these to anyone who is interested. However, don't abuse them or they most likely end up scratched, damaged, or lost. I'd say keep them in the cloth bag they come with when you're not using them. If you're looking at getting these sunglasses, I would say absolutely get them.\", 4622: \"I have been wearing Oakley GasCan sunglasses for a couple of years and wanted to try something new.  Unfortunately these didn't fit my face too well - my cheekbones made them not quite fit.I guess it's best to go try on the glasses first to see what fits and then buy.  Amazon prices are great!\", 4623: \"I had a pair of the Fuel Cell's in the same frame color and lens finish but got rid of them to get these. The Fuel Cell frames and the Batwolf are pretty much the smae with the exception on the Batwolf being more of a shield type lens...meaning instead of two separate eye lenses, there's only one lens in these. Because of the open eye area they fit my face better. The Fuel Cell frame makes me look like my eyes are too close together...not the case with the Batwolf. I've got a few other pair of Oakley frames (Antix & Oil Rig) and they all have the same single lens design. Love them!\", 4624: 'IT FIT ME VERY GOOD, I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. WILL BUY THE OAKLEY AGAIN. IT REALLY MAKE ME COOL.', 4625: \"These are nice glasses! They say for large face, but I disagree. They are a little snug.Overall I'm very pleased.\", 4626: 'I have owned Oakley for several years, but these \"Batwolf\" sunglasses are nice. There are comfortable and very stylish! I have already sent my boss to the website to buy!', 4627: \"Oakley is a good brand and I used to buy its glasses no matter it's model, they're really cool !\", 4628: 'great sunglasses. Very clear', 4629: \"Best sunglasses I have ever owned. Arrived in just a couple days and everythingWas perfect. Truly HD vision!! Thanks A Lot! SportingThese in Mexico in a few weeks! Can't wait!\", 4630: 'Having recieved these glasses as a gift, I thought I would go ahead and write a review for them, even though I did not purchase them through Amazon.These glasses are an excellent pair of shades. I happen to have a large head and that is generally my worry about purchasing glasses online, or having someone else purchase them for me. I wear a 7-3/4 hat size and when your noodle is that big, one-size does not fit all. Just like hats, I need a pair of shades that fit. These glasses fit like a dream.The glasses are very lightweight and although they do not feel cheap, they are much lighter than you would expect. This is a bonus for anyone who plans on wearing them for hours a day. They are very comfortable and do not fit too loose, nor too snug. they fit just right.Supposedly one of the great things about these shades is the fact that you can change out the icons on the sides and they have interchangable lenses too. The icons are around $12/pair and the lenses range from 55-90. In all honesty, if you are looking to purchase a lense and another set of icons, I would almost just drop the money and get a second pair of glasses. This will net you with 4 sets of icons, 2 lenese, and if you are smart, 2 different frames.At any rate, if you are in the market for a large pair of comfortable yet stylish glasses, this may be your answer. I would highly reccomend them to anyone who asks.', 4631: \"It's a good buy, cheapest place I found them no store could price match, same warranty as stores, good design, only needs polarized lens to make them nicer, but they mold to your head very nicely, suggest try them on in a store first\", 4632: 'I really like there design this is my second pair, I lost my first ones. The only reason I gave them 4 stars out of 5 is because like others haved said the lens do scratch easily so you have to baby them.', 4633: 'THESE SUNGLASSES ARE AWESOME, FIT GREAT AND THE LADIES LOVE THEM! LIGHT WEIGHT AND DO NOT LET SIDE LIGHT IN ETC..', 4634: \"Great price for Oakley sunglasses!!!!  I was surprised my son had these on his amazon wish list and was worried cuz I've only bought him black( his ways of accessorizing).  He loves them!!!\", 4635: 'I got these as a gift for my younger brother and he totally LOVES them.  They are well made well (of course) with a killer, aggressive design.  They are worth every penny and will last forever.', 4636: 'These glasses are sleak and look reallllly nice. I have 2 pairs, Clear/Blue Ice and Black. Always getting compliments on them ;)', 4637: 'Great sunglasses arrived quick good price. Never thought I would pay so much for sunglasses got tired of buy cheap that would break.

Great price too.\", 4641: 'Idk if I like the purple/blue lense. They are not the perfect golfing sunglasses. Now I need a deal on a pair of all black Oakley golf sunglasses.

Look nice, Comfortable, cuts glare nicely. Lighter than the old Gascans I had.  Can were them all day.', 4644: \"I bought these for light-duty glacier glasses that I could wear around town too. They are dark enough for this use and have good coverage so there's not much light sneaking in around the edges. My only complaint is that on account of this coverage, they don't have good ventilation and so fog up easily during exercise. An anti-fog coating might help.\", 4645: \"You can not tell but these frames are larger than the fuel cell's even though they look almost just like them. They are like a cross between fuel cell's and gas can's. I love them and I received fast shipping to afghanistan eve though the shipper was not Amazon.

He says he is getting complimented all the time on these glasses!', 4649: \"What can I say I love these shades. I have a wide face and I've always had problems finding sunglasses that fit me properly without any modification. The fit of these shades are perfect not too tight and not too loose, the arch doesn't hug your nose too tightly and are light. I can wear these all day without discomfort. I've had ray-bans before that were meant for wide face but they were too tight and the polarization seemed to be greenish as opposed to the polarization Oakley uses. These shades are also matte-black which is awesome, I hate the shiny gloss look. The lens is also replaceable.\", 4650: 'i recieved the package in very fast time , and i am in alaska awesum, aplus  merchandiser recommend to everyone', 4651: 'The sunglasses is same the description.

I bought the gold w/ writing and the writing is more subtle than it appears in the picture, which I actually really like. It\\'s not all gaudy and in-your-face.

Only reason I gave it 4 stars was I received the wrong color lense\", 4659: \"I like these sunnies. I bought the black polarised ones with gold ghost script on the frames.They look sweeet and people comment on them. They go with anything I wear; work, casual, more dressy. I have two gripes though: 1) they hurt my ears a little after a while where the frame sits on them, especially when wearing a cap (I didn't discover this until after I'd bought them and had worn them for a good hour or so); 2) they steam up really quickly, which happens if you've been working/walking/jogging, and they take a long time to clear up due to their close fit. But they look good and definitely ease the glare on your eyes.\", 4660: 'They feel great on and are really clear. If you are rough on them while cleaning the lenses try to come out but other than that they are great!', 4661: 'Great glasses, lenses are great to look through, comfy to wear, had people gawking at me the whole first day of wearing them, you wont be dissapointed in buying these glasses!!', 4662: 'Love these glasses.

My Story~ Okay, so I decided that, being 32 and everything, I should grow up and buy big girl sunglasses. Knowing absolutely nothing of sunglasses and brand names I chose Oakley sunglasses based on my eye dr.\\'s recommendation! So I got online with Amazon and chose a pair that I thought fit my personality and usability!! I classify myself as an teacher who spends lots of time outside (mostly on horseback, but gardening too) and is active. These sunglasses are AWESOME first of all! I do not feel like I have to take them off to see the ground better, or take them off because they are giving me a headache, and they do not cause motion sickness (troubles I have had with cheap-o sunglasses). They are really comfortable and very light! I originally planned on returning them because they felt HUGE on my small face (they sure felt like clown glasses at first, but don\\'t send them back!! They are worth the effort of \\'getting used to\\' them!), however after wearing them for a day, I could not put them in the box! I loved them alot. Now the sad part...Unfortunately, a month later, I was horseback and moved my sunglasses from my face to my hair to get a bug out of my eyeball when the temple piece ended up in my hand and my glasses on the ground! They had broken and absolutely NO pressure had been put on them! They felt so sturdy, and yet they broke. Now, I don\\'t know about you, but I can only put so much into sunglasses. I don\\'t know yet what amazon will choose to do about this because it is outside of the \"returns\" window. So I am returning them, but I ordered another pair irregaurdless of what Amazon chooses to do about this. Truly that is how wonderful I think they are. I hope that this is not an issue in the future!', 4669: 'I needed a pair of sunglasses that would stand up to being shoved in my purse without a case.

In addition, the wallet is able to hold 30+ bills in the two sleeves provided.My only gripe is the width of the wallet. It can be hard to get in and out of a pocket especially if you are wearing slim fit pants. But, I rarely do so that's not a big issue.\", 4687: 'Bought this wallet for my boyfriend. It has plenty of card slots with 2 bill compartments.

Although there were a couple minor imperfections on one of the lenses (the average consumer may not even notice, but I used to work in a sunglass shop, so to this day I still catch these things), I loved the overall look and couldn\\'t go back to the a-hole reflective lenses.

I'm on the third pair and I've had my glasses for about two years. I'm OCD about small scratches so it may just be me.

Weather proof sunglasses like most of Oakleys and superb quality. The only little problem I had was that these were the last pair at the Oakley store in Pennsylvania.. and they were a floor product, meaning it was used by other people to see how they fit and such. But I could care less. They charged full price with new lenses and the glasses were practically new so I could care less. I paid around 260$ with tax on these babies. I have used them for summer, trips to Cancun, Punta Cana, Hawaii.. these are tough glasses and won't break or come apart easily. I accidentally dropped them with key in my pocket and the right lens scratched a bit. So now I just carry them in the case it came with.. the case is also a hard shell that'll protect it from mostly anything. I called Oakley and they sent me some new lenses for free with a copy of the receipt to make sure I bought from an authorized retailer. And I love showing these off, these cannot be faked due to the hinges and the design and the way it opens to change the lenses people always give me compliments on these. Overall a great buy.. I love the blue tint lenses and you should buy them for a couple of extra bucks, but the standard ones that come with it are awesome too. They're made to be the most durable and most sun reflecting sunglasses and stylish at the same time. I'd rate this honestly a 9.5/10 due to the fact that the lenses can scratch quite easily, other then that, these are perfect for that average vacationer who spends most time outside in the sun.\", 4709: 'i wish it was a little darker.if you driving against the sun it wont really help as you expect it to.', 4710: \"What a great watch.

After wearing the lenses for about 3 days noted that the right side has a some slight discoloration. Doesn't affect the performance though but was a little disappointed that I did not inspect the lenses thoroughly. My bad.The OO Red lens does want it says gives you clarity beyond words and is not too dark like the black iridium. Of the various lens owned, the Red lens would be the best for driving. Was using a pair of gold iridium it's good for bright day driving however whenever you enter tunnel or basement carparks, you'll need to remove your sunglasses.

The prints are always unique, the quality is great and they have little details like zippers and pockets and tabs, which sets them apart. Even the front tie has the Oakley logo on it. Great green print too, goes great with many color t-shirts.\", 4716: \"Very comfortable and looks great, but order next size up.  They run a little small. This particular hoody has a media pocket, with yellow Oakley trademark accents.  This one is replacing one that I purchased seven years ago and while it still fits fine and is in one piece, it's too faded, okay worn out.  Happy to find this one.\", 4717: 'These board shorts look fantastic and are very comfortable. The pocket is a great addition as well. I did not pay full price; though, I got them like 50% off (if i remember correctly).', 4718: 'Awesome hoodie took me a while to find. Love this hoodie because the hood doesn&#8217;t end in a point when you wear it (you know that hood that makes you look like a cone head) If that bothers you like it does me then this hoodie is for you.', 4719: \"My husband looks great in these. They look expensive, the print is not too bright, it's a very elegant combination of black and red stripes. They are almost knee length, just like they look in the picture (my husband is 6&#34;1).

This is the first shirt I have bought on Amazon, and I was a little nervous about not being able to try it on.  However, it fit good and looked good as well.', 4733: 'Oakley Elemental Polo Size Large (Red/Gray)I normally wear size Medium polo shirts, but the size Large Oakley Elemental was a perfect fit and length for me. Although it is rather pricey, and has cheap thermal print logos, the material is extraordinarily comfortable and kept me dry throughout the day. Puma and Adidas both have polo shirts and athletic shirts made from the same style of polyester, but the Oakley color scheme works well with the red and gray.Overall: 4/5 stars, great fit, extremely comfortable material, but Oakley should have used embroidered logos or something more durable than the cheap thermal printed logos.', 4734: 'Oakley is a great brand I trust. I love the quality, fitting and the material which keeps me cool and dry. It is a very comfortable shirt.', 4735: 'These are great shirts, for the most part. Very comfortable material for the heat and very stylish too. The fabric wicks sweat away efficiently for exercising or just being in the outdoors. The stitching seems to hold up after many washes well also.However, I have ordered several of these shirts only to find that sizing is not consistent. On the white shirts, the sizing is one size larger. But on the blue shirts, I find the sizing to be normal or smaller then the white (considerably). Just something to keep in mind. I am 6\\'4\" tall with a 36\" waist/stomach and the XL in blue just barely fits me.', 4736: 'This pants is the bomb!  It is comfortable, stylish, and reasonable in price too.  Since I wore this, I received some compliments which never happened to me before.  I was a bit skeptical since I was not into Oakley clothing line but this one is a winner!  I highly recommend this for golfing or on a night out.', 4737: 'Was looking for a comfortable, light weight and water resistant golf pant and took a chance on these - bought a pair before a trip to Ireland to play and was the best piece of clothing I took with me!Very comfortable and they dry quickly.Two reasons I didn\\'t give them the fifth star ... FIVE STAR golf pants SHOULD have a mini pocket inside the main right front pocket to place your ball marker so it is easy to find, and, the length on these size 34 waist (33 inseam) is a little long for a 5\\'11\" frame and I snagged the pant on a nail head while walking across a bridge and it tore a 6 inch rip up the leg.  Had to have the pants repaired and hemmed a little shorter, but it was worth it.I carry/walk as often as I can and these pants are perfect.  Wore them almost everyday in Ireland where we encountered rain, blowing rain and extremely blowing rain.  Also had some nice sunny days.', 4738: 'My husband finally discovered these in his closet and was thrilled that i had bought them in every color. Very comfortable, sharp looking, lightweight pant.

The version I have are full leather but the new ones appear to be an updated version of them.  In a life of hiking, camping, and time in the Army, I have worn a number of different boots.  These are the most comfortable by far.  They are light but still strong and feel solid. I have worn some other \"performance boots\" but they felt more like a glorified sneaker than a boot.  I need my boot to still work and feel like a boot, just lighter and more comfortable.  These fit the bill.  Yes, they are expensive but you get what you pay for typically.', 4743: 'I just received my 6\" Oakley boots, WoW that was fast. They look good and feel comfortable.

I recommend them for people who work in security,military,police types jobs.', 4746: \"I purchased these in Afghanistan and was immediately pleased with them. They were comfortable from day one, and still are a year and a half after the purchase. Unfortunately I am back in garrison and they don't like seeing any boots other than brand new ones so I am here to buy another pair. My first pair may be dirty and beaten but they still have a lot of life in them and will still be used plenty in the field. I would (and do) highly recommend these boots to anyone willing to pay this much for boots that will outlast anything else the army issues, besides BCG's perhaps.\", 4747: \"Nobody enjoys breaking in a new pair of boots. These Oakley's are probably the easiest and most comfortable boot I've ever broken in. Although it still takes a long week to break in, they're exceptionally comfortable.

I'm not looking for style here (although they are handsome boots) just pure comfort....so at the end of the day my feet aren't barking at me!!

I STILL wear that pair off and on to this day March 2013), especially when I go off the beaten path hosting outdoor lazer tag games in mud-filled areas and in urban environments, and they still feel great. The laces are frayed as heck, the boots are mud-stained and look like they've gone to you-know-where and back, but they still get the job done. I'd love to get another pair so I have some that are shiny and new (shiny not to be taken literally, these are designed for field use, not to pass inspection stateside - that'd get you shot at...) but I cannot afford the price point these days now that I no longer have that disposable military income with nothing to spend it on :pIf you're looking for a long-lasting, dependable boot, look no further!These boots have outlasted 4 pairs of Oakley sunglasses so far (I wish they could make their polarized lenses as durable as these things.)\", 4749: 'these are great boots for a deployment light weight and good fitting either in the moutains or on foot patrols in the cities. long lasting as well', 4750: 'I picked up 3 pairs of these boots 2 in black and 1 in Coyote tan.

These Boots felt comfortable right out of the box. I've only had them a short while so I can' t speak about durability, but they wear and appear well built. Sizing is right on the money for American sizes; if you wear a 10, get a 10.\", 4752: 'I bought a pair a few years ago and was impressed, they also wore out after hard use.  These boots are better made with a more ductile sole.  The only issue holding it up from a 5 star rating is if they had speed laces.', 4753: 'Best work boots i have ever own. Very light, the soul is stitched up all the way around. Plus the bonus they look bad ass! Happy with this buy!', 4754: 'These are quality, comfort. great price,  and good looks all in one. I have not owned them long enough to tell about durability, but I am very happy with this purchase.', 4755: \"these boots are the best. they feel like your wearing a pair of tennis shoes. they stand up to anything i have deployed with the same pair of boots on 4 deployments. i'm ordering a new pair because after this deployment i will need a new pair they have just started to tear. this product is wonderful.\", 4756: \"Lets see if I can fit all this in here. On family day before my Army BCT Graduation (Aug 2011), a family member who had come for my grad) and I, went down to the Army Surplus Store in the Ft. Benning Georgia area. I walked in and asked the guy there to show me the best of the best in boots (I was willing to pay anything for something better than what I was using). He explained the basic differences between boots. Some were light weight, some were extremely rugged and cushioned but heavy, some were ULTRA LIGHT WEIGHT but ULTRA WEAK also, like the Nike (REALLY not made for field ops etc.) When he finally got to the Oakley SI Assault Boot. They were WAY to expensive $300, I thought they looked weird, heavy and uncomfortable, oh and did I say they looked WEIRD AS HELL&#8230; He said, yeah there a little strange looking and I know the price is kind of steep, but those who have bought them seemed to be REALLY HAPPY. I told him I was size 8 and to bring me the Oakley&#8217;s SI Assault Boots. I jumped into them and I was instantly ATTCHED. These boots were INCREDIBLEY Comfortable, light and felt like heavenly clouds on my tired feet especially after boot camp, I could not believe the deference. I&#8217;m sure the planter-fasciitis that everybody in my platoon was suffering would have been cured with these boots. They were just oddly comfortable to get up from the floor, unlike the flat sole of the original army issue boots, the iside sole is supper thick and soft, the bottom sole is made by Vibram (The people who make the soles for Five Toe&#8217;s and Rocky Boots also I think), the damn sole was SUPER flexible and cushioned with a perfect curve for running and sprinting. I swear I could step on a pointy rock or a pebble and it would disappear in the sole of the boot. I am not an APFT 300 Hooah Hooah soldier, but I can STILL outrun and leave most of my platoon behind when in full uniform, and I&#8217;m sure my footwear has something to do with it. Also the lace holes were very well designed though you have to understand and get used to them. The lower part could be tightened and adjusted independently from the upper part of the boot. Helping keep the flexion between tibia and foot easy while lifting the toes (if boot laces are too tight on the upper part you won&#8217;t be able to flex as easily). I STRONGLY recommend changing the Laces though, the laces that come with the Oakley SI Assault boot are terrible, short and to sticky. That's why I didn't give them the 5 Stars. I purchased a $2.00, 72&#8221; pair of laces at the AAFES and tied a little not on each end, VOILA BEST PAIR of boot ever. Just pull the laces from the middle then the top and you got yourself a perfectly laced boot. Its 2014 and I am STILL using the same pair of boots. They have been with me through AIT, and almost 3 full years of service. These boots might not be perfect for everybody, by I am getting another pair JUST to have a clean pair for those days I&#8217;m not out in the field.BTW I&#8217;m a 68W10 combat medic for a Ground Ambulance Co. and we train hard, as if your life depended on it.\", 4757: 'The only issue I have with these boots after going through two pairs is their lifespan, which is fairly lacking compared to other combat boots I have worn.  They are very comfortable boots with great traction.', 4758: 'I used these boots for multiple adventures in the Sand Hills game lands under heavy weight.  They held up well and provide a good deal of ankle support.  I\\'ve easily put over 100 miles on these boots across a variety of terrain to include many many draw systems, river crossings, sand, etc all under a ruck.  The thing you have to pay attention to is where the boot is constructed.  There are two versions in which one is constructed \"off shore\" as described by Oakley, and the other being \"Crafted in the USA.\"  If you visit Standard Issue you will see the two variations as options for purchase.  I spent 130 dollars on mine and its been worth every penny.  Comfortable, good shock resistant Vibram sole, complete sole stitching around the entire boot to ensure the sole does not separate, and supportive with a good degree of traction.  If you have a wobbly ankle then consider these or the Garmont T8.', 4759: \"They fit just right , lightweight and I don't have to mess with them wen I have them on .\", 4760: \"Very comfortable, great protection from glare.  The plastic feels a bit cheap versus other Oakley's I have - you sort of think; &#34;how much did I pay for this piece of plastic?&#34;  I also wear the Jarbra Sport bluetooth headphones which are thick at the top of the ear, so are these glasses.  So when jogging, the combination doesnt really work well as headphones are not seated in place in the ear properly ... when am I going to get it right!  Would I get them again, so far yes.\", 4761: \"Fantastic item but fit didn't seem that different from the regular fit. Ended up using the smaller nose piece as the bigger one made the glasses stand too tall.For those considering Asian fit, try the regular one too so that you don't end up limiting your options.\", 4762: \"I owned the non-Asian fit version of these glasses prior to buying this pair. I actually lost them before a road trip so I ordered these and got them overnight for $4 thanks to Amazon Prime!They fit my face perfectly. I'm Korean and have a rather broad face with a non-existent nose bridge with VERY high cheekbones. They fit my face extremely well and stay in place.\", 4763: 'I wasn\\'t too sure if this item was going to fit my face because I tried other Oakley\\'s before and it sort of hugged my face where the bottom of the lenses would touch my cheeks.  These Asian fit glasses fit perfectly.  I\\'m not saying that it will fit all Asian faces, but it did come with a second \"nose bridge\" piece if the default one didn\\'t fit your face right.  I like the design and it also came with a case and microfiber cloth.', 4764: 'These sunglasses always get complemented.  I love the polarized lenses.  They make a huge difference in being able to see well.  The Asian fit is great for someone with a thin face.  This is actually my second pair, I like them so much.  The lenses adapt to so many colors.  They can look red, pink or purple depending on the colors that you are wearing,  Great to do business with them.', 4765: 'Love my new Oakleys! They are very stylish. I wear contacts and these are very clear to look through. They were shipped to me very soon. I love the case and drawstring pouch, too.', 4766: \"I bought this pair last month and below are the pros/cons:Pros:1.  Comfortable to wear2.  Extreme protection against glare3.  Frame is VERY sturdy and tough.  I've bang it against my car door many times and not a single scratch can be detected.4.  Lens are extremely durable also.  I was fixing a plumping leak and hit my head with my sunglass on the top of my head against the cabinet and cookware.  Again, not a single scratch on the lens.  VERY happy about this.5.  Conventional styling which is what i've been looking for in Oakley since most are sport looking.6.  This sunglass is so tough that i'm planning on using it at the gun range to protect my eyes without worrying about flying shells putting a dent or scratches against the frame or the lens.Cons:1.  The right side is very squeaky.  I'm going to try to put some Ballistol lubrication on the plastic that holds the frame and see if it will eliminate the squeaky noise.Overall:  4 1/2 star.  Would have been 5 star if i wasn't bother my the squeaky noise.Oakley Jury Sunglasses - Matte Blk X 1Sz Size\", 4767: \"These glasses are great.  The lenses are awesome even though they are not polarized they sure seem like they are.  They fit great.  I have a pretty narrow/medium sized face and it is hard finding glasses that look good.  I tried these on in a store and they looked great.  I like that they are made of aluminum, they have some weight to them and don't feel flimsy like other Oakley.  The ear peices are breakaway too so even if you sit on them they will survive.  I definitely recommend.\", 4768: 'I was more than happy with the look and quality of these sunglasses for the price that I paid here on Amazon.', 4769: 'Lo recomiendo, son bonitos, c&oacute;modos, la montura es de aluminio y se siente bastante resistente.

I have two pr of these and both are non-polarized lenses, warm grey and dark bronze. These lenses are both under appreciated by O devotees. The Jury's frame is certainly sturdy but also classic and very cool. My two frames are the distressed grey and dis brown, both of which are classic. These are my fav Oaks and my cheapest too. I think they are Sunglass Hut exclusives and can be obtained for under 80 bucks on line. I cannot attest to the durability because they are new.\", 4773: 'perfect glasses, my husband loves them. Can be used at all times even in close quarters. Easy to clean and care.', 4774: 'Cool sunglases, I am full satisfaction with this.I am gonna recomended to my friendsSo cheeper that I thingI like this item', 4775: 'I must preface this review by stating that I am not an Oakley fan.  I find most of their sunglasses overpriced, faddish and not nearly as effective as they routinely claim.  I only gave this pair a try because I needed a new pair of sunglasses (thank you rogue wave) and they were polarized and half-off.  That said, I am extremely impressed with this model.  They fit extremely well (I have a narrow oval face shape) and the lenses have incredible clarity.  Many other reviews I\\'ve read indicate that this model weighs a lot.  Well, either my last pair of sunglasses (Kaenon Arlo) was extremely heavy or other \"weight sensitive\" reviewers just don\\'t wear sunglasses very often.  The frame is made of aircraft aluminum.  Now, I\\'m no expert, but I\\'ve held an empty aluminum can in my hand and it seems to weigh about the same.  The rubberized ear-stems and nose-piece are a very nice addition and help keep frame in place when I\\'m sweating excessively too.  Overall, I\\'m very happy with this purchase.  I would have never paid full price ($250 plus) but for half-off they are an exceptional deal and well worth it at that price point.  If you are considering purchasing them, do it now as they are a discontinued model.', 4776: \"These are my favorite sunglasses I've ever owned. In fact this is my second pair. I tend to lose my sunglasses about once a year, so I've had quite a few pairs of Oakley and others. You can't beat the look of these.

The sunglasses are also polarized which I like. They were shipped quickly and came with a bag.', 4778: \"At first they felt a bit over built and heavy but when I put them on they felt great.

Purchased these as they are very similar to what I had (these are black vs dark grey for my older pair).Very nice glasses.  Frame is very similar however the hinge is a new design.  So far works great.  Optical quality is actually better than my other pair.  A little tight around the temples at first but fit great after a couple of days.  These are all metal and very sturdy.

Not too small or overly obtrusive on face.', 4800: \"Excellent product. No problem at all. I'm from Colombia, later i write about the product performance and the other comments about it.\", 4801: 'PROTIP:  When considering these, research Revo Titanium first.First, let me just state that I\\'ve own a number of high end sunglasses over the past decade, e.g,  Revo, Gargoyles, Spy, Prada, Costa Del Mar, Vaurnet, Black Fly, Suncloud, Maui Jim, etc...  I\\'m fairly certain I know what I should expect from an expensive pair of sunglasses.I just received my Oakley C Wire sunglasses and quite frankly I\\'m a little disappointed.  The one thing I was sure that I would be happy with, the overall fit, were good.  The arms rested a little more tightly above the ear than was comfortable.  This is due to the fact that the arms are static.  In fact, the arms/spring/hinge has a stiff feel with very little give.  There is no \"spring\" in the \"spring-hinge\" mechanism.  Which is my first real complaint.  You will need to bend these to fit them.My other real complaint?  For $220 there isn\\'t even a hard case included.  Other sunglasses in the same price range that I own, Revo, Prada, Kaenon, Costa Del Mar and Maui Jim all come with their own hard cases that are excellent for storage.  All that is provided is a micro fiber pouch.The real disappointment stems from the fact that for the same price you can get a really nice pair of Revo\\'s that are mechanically and technically superior.  No, I\\'m not talking about both company\\'s use of polycarbonate lenses with techno-geek words...  We all know that modern plastic lenses do the job pretty well.  Not as efficient or optically consistent as glass, but lighter, cheaper and more durable.  I\\'m talking about overall design, craftsmanship and materials used in making the frames.  Compared to my Revo Efflux Titanium sunglasses, the Oakley\\'s are clearly a step down.For around the same price you can get one of the various Revo Titanium sunglasses.  They have true spring hinges that put less pressure on your head and has a more immediately comfortable fit.  The arms on the Revos open and close with presence.  The Oakleys open and close with a light but consistent pressure which doesn\\'t feel too cheap, but it doesn\\'t come close to Revo.  The Revo frames are much more stiff than Oakley but end up being much more comfortable, and this is immediately noticeable as well.These aren\\'t horrible but if you\\'re in the market for these sunglasses, definitely search \"Revo Titanium\" and try a pair of those first.  You won\\'t regret it.  They are in every respect that matters, far better than the Oakleys.Edit:  After a few days of wearing them, I think I\\'ll keep them.  They are nice.  I had these rated at 3* earlier because they didn\\'t come with the hard case.  The sunglasses are starting to grow on me a little, so the deduction is for the lack of a hard case.  That\\'s clearly unacceptable for a >$200 pair of sunglasses.', 4802: 'Great lenses, very happy. I own 5 pairs of oakley. feel good and polarized is a must. Great price and deal', 4803: \"I wanted a pair of sunglasses that I could wear while running that wouldn't slip off my face but would also be stylish enough to wear for other occasions and these fit the bill perfectly...love them!\", 4804: 'Bought these as a gift...She absolutely loves them!!

What impressed me with this was after wearing it for a while i realised it doesnt hurt my temples like my day to day reading glasses. It has a outer curve handle so it doesnt touch you temples...makes it very comfortable for extended wearing time. Polarised function is effective, enough eye coverage...I noticed some things i look at has a kind of spectrum of colors on them, like atm machines etc...but its only because the glassess &#34;strips&#34; light from these items to there colors. Wish it came with a hard case though.', 4806: 'Purchased these as a Christmas gift for a friend to replace the previous pair that somebody &#34;borrowed&#34;!

I\\'ve been an avid Oakley owner since 1993, due in large to their customer service and the overall style of Oakley glasses.  I saw another revue that said this model was \"too fragile.\" I don\\'t see it; they are sturdier than most other \"Aviator\" type sunglasses.  The polarized lenses are a must, as well.

I had purchased him before the beautiful Ray Ban but he did not use them at all. He says that the Oakley is very light and the aviator frame is what he has always liked. The only thing he disliked is that the sunglasses lacked the cleaning cloth that always comes with any glasses. I had to purchases in addition the Oakley's case, which is very good though it should be offered with the glasses even when the price would be higher.\", 4823: 'Bought it for a guy who absolutely loves it and wears it everyday.

Good lens. Felt perfect for my eyes. But one thing really disappointed me is the description says \"Made in USA\". But unfortunately it isnt. It\\'s made in china. I bought it from AMAZON seller. Worried that its fake I contacted oakley and they assured me it isn\\'t and all the metallic frames are made now in china and the lens is made in USA.I personally did a further deep search on this and found out that the luxurious brand luxottica purchased oakley same way as they purchased Ray-ban. So because of this the Made in China is starting to roll out. Its really disappointing from Oakley. the 1 star down just because of the MADE IN CHINA. I hope there is no flaw in this.', 4826: \"I like how it is very light.  The temple of my nose usually has a mark whenever I wear my Rayban Wayfarers (just for comparison; I know wayfarers are made of heavier material) but this one barely leaves a mark.  The lens is very good; love using it for driving during sunny days to reduce glare.  I drive a motorcycle and its skinny frame design makes it a nice fit inside the full-face helmet.  Despite people saying it looks flimsy and may break, I think it is well made and should be fine without any rough housing.The red frame, I found to be, is a negative.  It only goes with certain outfits (I'm finally starting to become aware of fashion, lol).\", 4827: 'Excellent crystal sharp polorized lenses.  Fabulous looking and well fitting frames.

Would recommend.', 4836: \"To start off I bought from an amazon fulfilled vendor payed more but  it assured I got the real deal, They arrived in the Oakley box and had a good quality frame and lens. I'm not sure who and where people are finding &#34;made in china&#34; stamped on there glasses but that is why I payed a little more to go through a fulfilled vendor. I'm not exactly sure if the Oakley chrome lens are legit Oakley lens, but I cant seem to wear aviators unless they have that chrome look and they are real good clear quality lens anyways.\", 4837: \"This pair of glasses are very clean and I bought them to use when I go to work.

Overall, they are great in color yet a bit small for his face.', 4844: \"All oakley sunglasses are made in china. I bought mine direct from the store and they do not say Oakley but do have the name of the glasses on the right arm and on the left there is an O with a part number so don't be afraid that they are fake, they're not. As far as the fit, they are awesome, far superior to any other sunglasses available. The HDO lenses are amazing and I can barely feel them on my face. They are a bit fragile so be careful but all in all the offer excellent protection, crystal clear clarity and look super cool\", 4845: \"I love this pair. I really take good care of it as I don't spend $100 on a pair of glasses. And in all fairness, it's been 3 years and it's still looks amazing.  When you found the perfect shape for you, you tend to stick to it.\", 4846: 'I have owned these sunglasses for about six months now, and I wear them nearly everyday. I purchased the Infinite Hero Plaintiff, as I love purple and like what this foundation is doing through Oakley. This is by far my favorite pair of sunglasses. They look great and are extremely comfortable. If you like aviators, then you will love these. The only downside is that they are pretty fragile. I have quite a few scratches on them, and the frame is slightly bent. I recommend getting the hard case and microfiber bag to store them in when not being worn. Also, the hinge is very loose on one side. I took them to Sunglass Hut, and the girl working there tried to tighten the screws to fix the loose temple. She said the screw is stripped, due to me putting the glasses on top of my head when walking out of the sun.', 4847: \"Got them for my husband. Early father's day gift and he loved them! Thought the gold trim was a bit much but he said they were perfect\", 4848: \"I was very satisfied with these Aviator sunglasses, Oakley's priceis more reasonable, Gucci pricing for similar style is out of bounds.Save yourself some cash and go for Oakley, you will not be disappointed!\", 4849: 'I felt very happy, sent in real time and cash, I am pleased, high quality product, thank sent product information Oakley', 4850: \"Hi everybody... any one can tell me if this products comes with his box?? cause its not specified.. thank u, i'll wait for your answer for making a purchase. bye\", 4851: 'These are great sunglasses.  I love them and received many compliments on them. I work in the airwing of the Marine Corps and many of the Pilots were envious of my glasses.  The only problem was they broke about two weeks after I received them.  The hinge that connects the lens to the ear bar became bent.  Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy and sent me a new pair right away.  I live happily ever after.', 4852: 'Personally I do feel like there cheap I read the reviews about this pair but I could not find a \"made in china\" anywhere on these shades plus I bought them directly through amazon and there not fakes. The frame is a plastic however it feels like part rubber to its pretty flexible I give it 6 out of 10 due to the frame not being metal also I don\\'t think this is worth 90$ id say 40$ tops.', 4853: 'Comfort, Style & fit of a Plaintiff Aviator sunglasses. Dark lens are perfect to use in summer and all the year.', 4854: \"This glasses fit perfect to my face, they cover all the areas where the light can enter, the look awesome like a real fashion Top Gun movie guy jejeje best lenses so far. And I'm a huge fan of the brand!\", 4855: \"I ordered these sunglasses from Island Surf and I can't complain.  The item came in on the 14th, although the delivery was dated for the 16th-21st.  I was really happy with the delivery date since my plaintiff started shipping the very next morning.  The product seems to be the real deal as the material used are very nice and sturdy, also is listed as an Oakley registered dealer.Okay now to the sunglasses.  The Oakley Plaintiff (matte black) is made in very nice quality materials and I love how the lenses are very glossy on top of the matted black frame.  The fit seems to be nice and the frame seems to be sturdy. The overall look is very slick and simple, but still able to catch attention with others.  The only complaint I have about them is that they sit on my cheeks and that is mostly likely got to do with me being Asian.  If you wonder what being Asian got to do with it, then just look it up on Oakley website about their Asian fit sunglasses (didn't buy the Asian fit because of the lack of variety of styles). Otherwise the sunglasses are very nice. I didn't think of them as being too big or too small, as they are comfortable.  As far as optical viewing goes, I notice vs. my cheapos that the sunglasses produces good contrast and has a neutral color to them that helps bring out colors of objects, although darker than your normal eye sight without sunglasses.  I would say that I wasn't use to the fact that the sunglasses aren't very dark as my cheapos, but to it's defense, I believe it's better that way.  Sunglasses that are too dark usually distorting your viewing therefore not optimal way to see as it cause some sort of strain to your eye trying to focus.  The sunglasses are dark enough to where I don't have to squint my eyes toward direct sun, but the sun still very noticeable whereas my cheapo's I don't even think about the sun.  I'm sure part of this got to do with better visibility.  As Oakley classified these sunglasses for casual every day use, not for fishing etc.  If you are planning to use these out in direct sun all day then I'm not sure if the warm grey lens are for you as I don't think they shade enough. Just my opinion though as I can see other might think otherwise.  The sunglass does have some heftiness to it compare to plastic sunglasses, but as a metal frame it's light enough to not leave marks on my nose/face. I do feel confident enough to think that these will last me.Overall I am very happy with it.  The sunglasses does not feel and look cheap as my other aviator. Like for example my guess aviator somewhat look cheap as it has some white on the arm and they are heavy enough to leave marks on my face. In my opinion, if you are looking for aviator style sunglasses that don't make you look silly then this is an awesome pair of shades as these to me has a classy look without going overboard.\", 4856: \"I purchased this pair of sunglasses a couple of months ago and I'm using it almost everyday. I got the matte black with warm grey lenses.They look very good, specially if you have a big face (like me) and you like the RB aviator style. This have a very similar fit to the RB aviators 62mm, not so straight looking, covering a little bit more of your face.Very lightweight, I use them all the time for driving (I drive for an hour everyday and hardly notice i have them on!) or as a lifestyle pair.The lenses although scratch very easily so be careful, and purchase a case to carry them around with the microfiber bag. I've been trying to get some replacement lenses and they don't seem to exist online at least... so, as I said, take very good care of them!Like any pair of aviators, they are a little big fragile, so be careful not to sit or step on them, doesn't really matter if they're o-Matter and everything, they'll probably break.Bottomline: Great pair, but take good care of them.\", 4857: \"The first time I wore these, they turned heads immediately. They,re smooth, fit well & look super hott. You'll look like a boss in these for sure...\", 4858: 'They are exactly what I was looking for. They made a great gift and he was so excited about them.', 4859: \"I tried on various Aviators and these fit the best. They're a little curved (as opposed to the Ray-Bay version) so that they slightly wrap around your head. The one thing I didn't like (and has nothing to do with the glasses) is that you only get a cloth Oakley bag. I aso have a pair of Half Jackets and I received the Hard Case as well when I ordered those. It's too bad someone stole my Aviators at a local Denny's Restaurant three weeks after I received them. I liked them so much though I'm debating ordering another pair.\", 4860: \"Oakley never should've done away with these. If you can find them by. They fit good look great and there Oakley so you know the hold up.  I wish they had the black iridium lenses already in them but you can still get them from Oakley.com all in all it's pretty sweet deal\", 4861: \"So when I was on holiday in Sydney I bought an Akubra Silver Spur, which is the classic cowboy hat.Now I needed some shades to go with it for the Cowboy look. I wear Oakleys, Flak Jackets with +Red & Jawbones with Black Persimmon transition lenses, but I needed something more authentic so I gave these a try.First of all they have a perfect mirror, if you don't want people seeing your eyes as you perve on them then these are a great set of lenses, but what makes them better than the normal 'aviators' is how they have the classic Oakley curve - so they block out a lot more light on your periphery than normal.As other people have written in these reviews, if you're like me and have a heart shaped face/high cheek bones you will hit them when you smile, even more so than with Jawbones. So you should go to your local O-store/vault and try them on before ordering.Luckily my hat keeps them down when I laugh like a lunatic.Hats are coming back people!!!\", 4862: 'These are really good. The curvature on the sides does not allow much sunlight so no reflections. My ray ban aviators on the other hand are relatively flat so I see my eye reflection on it if the sun is at an angle. I use this as my primary sun glasses.', 4863: 'I absolutely love these glasses!  These are my second pair (dog ate my first pair).  Maybe Amazon sells well behaved dogs....', 4864: 'Oakley is a best eye wear I have ever owned. I have few and plan to get other designs as well. Amazon has the best price.', 4865: \"The fit is a little loose (not as tight as some other oakley's that i own), but it fits and doesn't pinch the nose whatsoever!\", 4866: 'Great looking glasses blocks sun light weight good for everyday use driving the car out on the boat or looking good when best dressed', 4867: 'Oakley sunglasses are always ahead of the curve when it comes to the latest optics, materials, and fashion. It\\'s a bit much for those of us that don\\'t snowboard for a living, but the Plaintiff brings all of the Oakley tech into a classic look. They\\'re deceptively simple looking, an aviator that doesn\\'t look much different than a pair of Ray Bans or a cheap pair you\\'d get at the drug store. But they are.First, the stems are soft and pliant. You\\'ll barely feel them and because they \"grip\" rather than needing to hook over your ears, they\\'re comfortable without shifting. There\\'s also an ingenious little spring that works very well and is stronger than it looks. Once on, they\\'re very nice. The curve Oakley has put on the lenses gives much more protection for the peripheral vision. Trying these on back to back with a pair of normal, flat aviators will surprise you. There is some \"edge bleed\" around the nose, but no more than on a regular pair, tho significantly more than more Oakleys.The materials are all top notch, the Oakley logos are subtle, and the look is (again) classic. If you want to look like you\\'re in the X Games, these aren\\'t for you. If you want a great pair of sunglasses, they are.', 4868: \"It was my husband's Birthday and i surprised him these glasses they are awesme. never thought it would fit him so well. he was so very happy.

I was getting tired of having two pairs of riding glasses. Tinted for day and clear for night. I decided to pull the trigger on the Oakley Windjackets. Having numerous pairs of Oakley's in the past, I knew I would not be disappointed, and I wasn't. They come in a nice case with extra nose guards and a strap to keep them from falling off your head. Also included with the Windjackets are tinted lenses and clear lenses, thus eliminating the need for two different pairs of glasses. I just keep the clear lenses in my vest for when I need them. Switching the lenses is simple, just pinch each nose guard to pop them out, swing the guards up, swing the bottom frame down, and out pops the lens. The wind gasket is great, blocks out all the wind. I tested them up to 85mph on the freeway and had zero issues. The great thing about the gasket, it's removable! So when I am done riding and still need shades, I can leave it on if I want, or take it off and I have a good pair of shades. While pricey, you can't beat Oakley's quality and I would highly recommend these Windjackets for motorcyclists and bicyclists alike.\", 4882: \"I was a little worried it wouldn't work because i have a smaller face.  It's true the glasses look a little big but they keep the wind out of my eyes.  Also the plastic feels much better and cleaner than the comparable foam lined ones.  Even though they are heavier with the plastic wind blocker they stay up fine without the strap.\", 4883: \"Long time Willy X Jake fan, forever, at least 6 pair, love em. Decided to try something different , These Wind Jackets blow the Willy X away, of course for more $$ but you get what you pay for. These do not fog up and the gaskets are way better than then Willy's, Never would of thought they would be that much better but they are. These are twice the mulla but twice as good so if you want to splurge go for them. I love them twice as much so there worth it\", 4884: \"I wanted to be able to see clearly without a face mask on my helmet and these work perfectly. Normal shades warp when I try to push them on in my full face helmet but these follow the contours of my head perfectly and fit like a dream. Comes with everything stated and I was greatly pleased that I don't have to use a face mask at all while driving. The lack of star is only because the dealer took over a week to deliver these when I selected two day shipping.\", 4885: 'Excellent productExactly as described on the site. Amazingo for runners and bikers.I use it when riding my Intruder 1400 with an open helmet and it works very good!', 4886: 'These glasses saved my eyes. I have had a serious problem with wind burn in the cold or on fast group rides. The glasses seal perfectly with the insert. You can pop the rubber seal off for less windy days and they still do a great job. I have never worn glasses with a head strap before, and I will never ride without one again. The glasses stay in place and are quite comfortable.', 4887: \"I actually bought these for driving in the car more than my motorcycle.  I have dry eye problems which can be very irritating.  These have a perfect fit to my face shape and the rubberized/neoprene type gasket material seals against my face and keeps the ventilation blowing on my face from drying my eyes out.  They have such a snug fit in fact that my eyes start to fog the lenses up if I push them too tightly to my face.  The gasket material is comfortable enough that it doesn't cause my face to sweat where the material touches my face, as it does on other foam backed riding glasses I've owned.  I like the clear lenses so that I can use them day or night.  On sunny days I can switch them out with the tinted lenses if I'm going on a longer drive.  The case that they come in is very nice, although a little large for easy storage.  The Oakley quality is evident in the construction of the frames and gasket design, I HIGHLY recommend these.  They are way better than other type of foam backed glasses I have owned before.\", 4888: 'I use them on my motorcycle, and have used a full face helmet, and 3/4. These glasses were perfect on both. I upgraded the lenses with Revant polarized ones which fit perfectly and were easy to install. The wind jacket did its job so at the end of the day my eyes were not dry or sore. I will purchase the same thing again if I lose this pair.', 4889: \"I've been buying Oakley sunglasses for over 10 years and refuse to wear anything else( this is my 5th pair). Yeah, they are a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. Before Oakley I used to buy two or three pairs of $25 glasses every year. They would either break or get scratched up. Then I bought a pair of Oakley glasses and were amazed. They were light, comfortable,durable and super scratch resistant. In fact, my son has my very first pair now and they still look great and they are over ten years old.I'm a motorcycle rider and when Oakley released the &#34;Wind Jacket&#34; I had to have a pair. Wow!! They fit great and the soft rubber gasket sealed to my face perfectly. So much better than the foam seals on other riding glasses. I love the fact that I can change the lenses too. You can buy a whole variety of different lens colors and they are easy to change. The seal removes easily also so you can wear them as regular sun glasses. They also come with a nice head strap that attaches to the glasses and holds them snugly to your face.\", 4890: 'This is my 5th or 6th Oakley ... If you consider that I only bought 2-3 sunglasses that belonged to other brands, you would understand how much I appreciate OakleyThe glasses are a bit bulky but they provide perfect protection', 4891: \"These are outstanding! A ton of accessories. Easy to interchange the lens on the fly. You do feel some wind blast creeping in around the frames (with helmet off. With helmet on - virtually none.) and the glasses are so light, they do want to make an attempt to escape your face at higher speeds (when not wearing a helmet or the security strap). However, I suspect this is a non issue if you have a larger/wider framed head. If you have a narrow head, this is a notable observation, but not a deal breaker. Overall, it's a great product I would recommend to other motorcycle riders.\", 4892: \"(cyclist here). I had a pair of half jackets for a number of years. Used em till they completely broke. The problem with them was that whenever I'd go fast down a hill my eyes would get hit by wind, causing me to tear up! Imagine seeing some dude riding by with tears running down his cheeks... yeah. Well These glasses are amazing, just what I was looking for. They block the wind, stay put, don't fog up while moving. Great addition to my kit.\", 4893: \"Great shades for the bike!  Very happy with them!  I tried many others, and I like these the best.  You pay more for Oakleys, but they're worth it.\", 4894: 'I use them use them for dragonboating and they work perfectly fine.

But please note that all of these companies also currently make *active* 3D TV models so double-check that your set uses the right technology before buying.  They will *NOT* work with the active 3D TVs made by Panasonic, Samsung and Sony, nor with the active 3D TV models made by Toshiba, VIZIO and LG.  So, again, make sure your set uses a passive 3D system before buying.  If your 3D glasses take a battery or a USB charger or have any blinking lights, then these Oakleys are *NOT* a suitable replacement.  But if your 3D TV glasses look like regular sunglasses then these are what you need.VIZIO calls their passive 3D sets \"Theater 3D.\" LG calls their passive 3D sets \"Cinema 3D\" and Toshiba calls theirs \"Natural 3D.\"  Confused yet?  Well welcome to the wacky world of 3D TV... and don\\'t shoot the messenger!These Oakley 3D Gascan glasses also work great in RealD 3D movie theaters, which is the most common type of 3D movie theater out there right now.  A handful of 3D movie theaters around the world use Dolby 3D, which uses spectral filtering (as opposed to circular polarization).  For those, you will want to use the glasses handed out in the theater because the Dolby 3D system is not compatible with any 3D glasses that use circular polarization (including these Oakley 3D glasses).  IMAX theaters also use a slightly different format, so these Oakley 3D glasses will not work in an IMAX 3D theater. But to add one more little wrinkle, if your 3D theater features Dolby Digital Surround Sound (but is in RealD 3D), then these will be fine.  When did life get so complicated??In terms of performance, I tested these glasses primarily with a VIZIO 65-inch passive 3D (\"Theater 3D\") HDTV set, theVIZIO XVT3D650SV.  The Oakley glasses provided a nice upgrade from the free 3D glasses included with the set: the curved lenses provided a more immersive field of view, and the colors were more accurate with slightly higher brightness (again, compared to the free glasses included with the TV).  They also worked well in a RealD 3D movie theater, providing a nice upgrade to the free glasses handed out at the door, not to mention greater comfort.Are they worth the higher price?  That depends.  If you want a high quality experience watching 3D films in theaters and on a passive 3D TV set at home, or if you want a more stylish, high quality set of 3D glasses, then the Oakleys are a good choice.  There are less expensive alternatives out there, but in my humble opinion, the higher quality of the Oakley glasses justifies the price.  They\\'re also available in a \"The Hobbit\" version for potentially less money here: Oakley 3X GasCan The Hobbit with HDO-3D Special Edition SunglassesTurn-Ons:* Stylish design* Excellent image quality* Curved lens creates more immersive field of viewTurn-Offs:* Expensive* Cannot be used as sunglassesOur full review of the Oakley 3X Gascan 3D glasses is available at BigPictureBigSound (dot com).', 4897: \"I use these with my LG 3D TV and when going to the movies. These are passive glasses not active shutter which seems obvious but based on the negative review maybe not obvious to everyone.Already I was using a regular pair of Gascan for my everyday sun glasses and I find them very comfortable so these fit exactly the same. I would suggest if you are not familiar with the fit of these glasses head down to the oakley store or sunglass hut and try them on first.The 3D effect was much improved both at home and at the movies, the lens don't darken the picture as much as the cheap free glasses. The 3D images seems much brighter.These glasses have improved 3D for me and I hope they will for you as well.I ordered from Amazon at 10pm Thursday night and had them 14 hours later at noon Friday.\", 4898: \"First of all, I would like to say, this Oakley 3d glasses is the best product I've ever bought.  The glasses is so much clearer than those regular free realD 3D glasses you get from the theater and it give you a crisp view of the 3D detail.  The fitting feels great, it feel like your wearing a sun glasses to a movie theater.  I would have to say this is one of the best product I've purchase from Oakley.  The glasses only work with realD 3D theater which is almost all the place around the world and I would say it is worth the price.  I would recommend this glasses to anyone who doesn't like the free 3D glasses you get at the movie theater.\", 4899: 'I absolutely love this hoodie. It is so soft and comfortable and fits perfectly. I wanted to order another one in the pink but they do not have my size.', 4900: 'I love this sweatshirt, especially with fall weather here.  It is different than any hoodie I have because it is long and that means it is warmer and cozier.  I would love some other colors!', 4901: 'This sweatshirt is amazingly comfortable.  I love the longer length and warmth it offers!  Definitely would recommend this to others!', 4902: \"The description says these jackets are made of nylon but they are in fact made of 67% polyester/33% cotton. They are machine washable. The material is thick enough to keep you warm on a chilly day. It's a soft, snugly jacket. I love the look. I tried all 3 colors and the black looks the best in my opinion. It's a keeper!\", 4903: \"I got an Oakley hoodie in the Oakley store about 3 years ago and love it still. After many washes it still fits true to size and doesn't appear too worn. I wanted to invest in another one and chose the pink one here. It fits great and is so soft. These hoodies are very warm so don't get it if your looking for something thin and light. I love throwing on a tank, this jacket, jeans and sneakers for errands whatever around the house. I highly recommend this jacket.\", 4904: \"I ordered 4 of these sweat shirts in a variety of colors, all for less that $15 each, and was very happy with the quality. I am a breastfeeding mother and was just looking for something cute that opened in the front, but these far exceded my expectations. They are a medium weight, very soft, and the colors are vibrant and lovely. The zippers are good quality too, so I don't worry about them breaking! Overall, a great buy!\", 4905: \"This shirt goes down to the tops of your bottom and thighs, so I was careful to order the shirt according to my hip size.  I am a 34B but wear a size 8/10 pants.  I order the Large shirt and it fits comfortably around my thighs and a bit loose on top, but it's a workout shirt so still looks great.  The black and gray shirt looks fab with my black yoga pants.\", 4906: 'Thanks to the first reviewer, I ordered a size up.  I usually wear a small but ordered a medium and they fit very nice, maybe a tiny bit too big, but much better than being too small! They dont really look like a board short when on, more like an athletic short so I would wear these for much more then in the water. I am looking around for other colors and suggest you do the same because you will love these.  Also the lenght is perfect, not too long, but not like the shortie shorts.', 4907: 'these are great board shorts. The fit comfortably, not too tight. The length is a little longer than what I am used to, but they still look nice on.', 4908: 'I received my order on time and was pleased with the quality of the swim short material. The only problem was that the shorts do run a tad bit small. I can still wear the shorts but prefer a little wiggle room.', 4909: \"While they weren't the exact size I wanted, I was still very pleased with these board shorts. I love the oakley brand, and these were a really good length too. Not super short, but not way long bermudas either. I'd definitely buy apparel again from oakley! A positive product and experience, all in all.\", 4910: \"Comfortable board shorts. I bought these because I go sailing and want more coverage than a bathing suit. I particularly like how the waistband doesn't gap in the back like a lot of others. Very nice fit and look flattering. I thought they fit just right to size.\", 4911: \"I bought these to wear with a tankini top. I just don't care for regular swim bottoms anymore, they just don't fit right. These are great for swimming in and dry fast, and you don't feel so exposed. I thought they were a tiny bit to long though. So I rolled them up a bit, pressed them and stitched them in place, and now they are great!\", 4912: 'I bought these in a size 4, Neo Viridian color.  I think they run pretty true to size for this kind of design (normally in shorts I would wear a 0 or 2, but that is a totally different construction from this style).  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons.  1: I wish they were an inch shorter.  I am very petite, and I think they would just look better on me a little shorter.  2: The drawstring should be a contrasting color.  It doesn\\'t look that great being the same color as the shorts.  Otherwise, I am very happy with the item.  There are two snaps in the \"fly\" which, when open, make the shorts really easy to pull on.  Also, the waist is a very tailored fit.  I think they would still be ok for someone less curvy than myself, but be aware they are probably not great for a straight waist girl.', 4913: \"I am a 11/12 wide hip smaller waist person and I like my shorts and pants etc. to sit right on my hips.  I ordered these and they were just a tad to small and I figured I'd get the larger size.  Amazon at the time didn't have the 13/14 so I bought else where.  I do use these all the time with a nice tankini top and it works so nice.  I hate wearing bathing suites to this is a perfect replacement.\", 4914: \"Great shorts for the beach; very flattering! I've just tried them on - still need to wear them in the water and see if the color stays. but so far, so good! Pink is a cute color as well.\", 4915: \"it was delivered on time, and it looks great on me!definitely wearing it when i wanna have fun~i don't know whatelse to write, but they are making me write 20 words.I hope this will be enough.\", 4916: \"After the first time in the caribbean ( from Missouri) I realized jean shorts don't work too well kyaking, etc. in the ocean... Purchased these for my second cruise and they worked as expected and the quality is nice too. Shipping was fast and they where well packaged. However when washing them although they are fabric they should be treated like a swimsuit and drip dry rather than go in the dryer. They still fit, just a little snugger than I like....\", 4917: 'I was looking for a turquoise short and not knowing what \"Viridian\" was thought these would be a good match, based on the image. Turns out these are more green, than turquoise.A sizing note: I usually wear a size 6 in clothing and ordered a 9/10 in the shorts. These were loose in the hip but had a flattering cut.', 4918: 'I really liked the shorts but they were way too small so had to return them.  On the plus side, Amazon return experience was a breeze.', 4919: 'I ordered the yellow color in SMALL and I really love the color, fit and design are great too!That is all, thanks...', 4920: 'This bikini top is really nice. Medium is the way to go if you have C to small D breasts.', 4921: 'This top was perfect to wear while ziplining and diving into waterfalls in Costa Rica - great support, stayed in place well when wet and dry. It provided perfect coverage without being matronly. Was not see through when wet either.', 4922: 'I am at the beach a lot and have fair skin.  I bought a few rash guard shirts and this one fits like a womens t-shirt, went up a size.  I think it is pretty true to size, wish I had gone smaller.', 4923: \"no complaints at all.  i've worn this cover up a few times & still remains in great condition.  no regrets\", 4924: 'I ordered this tanktop in the black stripe. The fit was true to size and the fabric was very light and breathable. Perfect for summer. Overall a good deal for the price.', 4925: 'Soft, comfortable top. Colors are vibrant. Great for working out. Unusual placement of pocket but pocket comes in handy (e.g. iPhone or MP3 player, Kleenex, etc.) during workout. Contrasting stitching around deep Pocket is nice. A bit long falling slightly below hip level. The white Pocket Tank is slightly \"see through\"  whereas the colored tops are not. Washes well and colors stay bright.Nice top.', 4926: 'Sexiest running shirt ever. It looked great in all of my hiking photos and did it\\'s job too. I wore it hiking for 5 days and then to a club directly after without showering (gross!), but I still looked hot and the shirt didn\\'t smell at all. I danced all night and made out with a cute boy. Seriously though, this shirt is the most low cut shirt that I own. I tried it on and was nervous that I shouldn\\'t wear it outside. I\\'m 5\\'2\", 105lbs 34D, and the small fits perfectly (even the built in bra).A+', 4927: \"i like the style and the t-back, well-made tank top, it was a slightly larger fit than some other medium tanks i've ordered, so i had to return it, but otherwise, i would have kept it. i am not really slim or really wide - but the bust/back area was too roomy for me.the material was comfy and i like the cut of the neckline a lot. i will try and order it again but in a small.\", 4928: 'I wore these while I was hiking through the Andes. They\\'re definitely for warmer weather and were not a huge help during the super cold nights, but they didn\\'t stretch out too much nor did they start to smell after 5 days. Pretty impressive.

Good at everything.', 4931: 'Very nice backpack for students. Lots of room and a padded section for a laptop.  Order shipped very fast.  The only concern was that when we saw it on Amazon, the color looked darker and more navy blue.  But this was fine, the color is actually brighter and better.', 4932: \"I have worn this pack for several days. I love it. I love the ability to put my laptop in the side pocket and have easy access. I use the phone pocket on the shoulder strap as well. You can answer your phone, put it on speaker and it is right there and allows you to talk normally. I love the low profile buckles and the layout of the pack. I don't trust my Oakley Half Jackets in the mesh sunglass holder so I still use my old skool Oakley sunglass case. I am able to carry my laptop, Kindle, associated cords, half a dozen movies, work folders, pens, and many other small items easily. There was alot of thought put into the construction of this pack. I would re-purchase this item in a heartbeat and this color scheme is my favorite. 10 of 10 on this one. It is the perfect sized pack for a general use day pack. Did I mention is had a cool factor with it? The 2 Oakley insignia on it are great. I read in prior reviews that people didn't like the way the handle was built into the straps. I have no problem with the handle where is it. It is comfortable to carry.\", 4933: 'Magnificent sunglasses, many friends have tried it and go with all types of faces, in addition to the excellent overview offered in both the sun and the rain!

She seems to very much like them.', 4940: 'Excellent sunglasses. Very happy. Will definitely buy other shades here in future. 2 day shipping is great! Hoping they hold up as I dont much care to spend this kind of money on plastic.', 4941: 'I got tired of the zippers on the oakley zip hard cases failing so I order this case. It was a great decision. My crosshair 2.0s fit perfectly in them. The design is great and the case looks and feels better in person than it does in the photographs.', 4942: \"This is a well-made case. It looks nice, and it is the perfect fit for my Oakley sunglasses. It's also lined with soft fabric to protect the lenses.\", 4943: \"I bought this case to hold a pair of Holbrook's I purchased.

Being in the military I move around a lot and things get thrown into a bag, into the trunk, onto the ship and back again.  This case has done it's job and then some.

I like it better than the Oakley zip up case I bought.\", 4948: \"Bought this for my Crosshair 2.0's. It came right on time, and was packaged well. It has nice hinges, with a good spring action (not to strong, but enough to get the job done). The outer shell has a nice ribbing which makes it easy to grip, and all signs are that it is tough enough to protect a $200 pair of shades. This is what I have come to expect from Oakley.I have had these for a couple of months now, and they are holding up extremely well.\", 4949: \"Fit my gascans in here nicely. It's a strong hard case with a tight close to it so your glasses won't fall out. Just what you should get if you don't want to smoosh your glasses.\", 4950: 'When you invest upwards of $200 on more on quality sunglasses, you really need to invest in a case like this.

It is a must have for expensive glasses. It fits nicely in the console of my car.', 4952: 'Its a nice case. Simple enough, its just a standard clam-shell style hard case. Lining is protective for the finish and lenses of my Fuel Cells. It is also sharp looking, although the covering is sort of \"odd looking\" on the corners because of how it is adhered to the case body which is the only reason I went with 4 stars. A good buy, no complaints.', 4953: 'THIS WAS NOT FOR ME IT WAS FOR A FRIEND, THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IF THIS HELPS IS THAT ITS ORIGINAL, GREAT PROTECTION FOR YOUR GLASSES AND THE QUALITY AND FEEL OF THE COVER, IS GREAT.', 4954: 'This case is awesome. Purchased for a pair of Oakley Jupiter Squared shades. They fit nicely inside with the pouch and a cloth without rattling around too much. The case is hard and snaps shut. Provides great protection and the outside is cool!', 4955: 'Very stylish and functional. I would consider getting a few more in different colors to leave at my other offices.', 4956: 'Great case for my oakley straight jacket sunglasses. I no longer worry about scratching the lenses when storing them. It is a very sturdy case and will keep the sunglasses safe.', 4957: 'Classy yet functional!!!!!  The Oakley Style Switch sunglasses fit great!!!  Came exactly as described, would definitely recommend this case!!!  Awesome', 4958: \"Nice clam style case.  I don't see why this doesn't come standard with most of the Oakley sunglesses.  Although a little pricey, a good investment to protect your Oakely sunglasses.  I use this case for my Fuel Cell style sunglasses and they fit fine.\", 4959: 'Fantastic case. Oakley Crosshairs fit perfectly. Well made, stylish and attractive. I usually keep it in my truck or my boat, and nearly everyone that sees it, compliments it. It appears to be holding up well and has protected my sunglasses perfectly. May seen a little pricey, but the quality is there. Will definitely purchase another when the need arises.', 4960: \"I really like this case. It seems plenty sturdy and easily fits my Polarized Oil Rig. The Oil Rig has a very wide frame so it doesn't fit many standard eyewear cases.\", 4961: 'I am terrible about sitting on my sunglasses.

I wasn't sure if this case would work for one or the other pair so I only purchased one case.  Each pair fits in this case just fine.  I will be purchasing a second case so that each pair can have its own case.This case is a little bulky but it's solid, and closes tightly.  You can also fit the sunglasses and the fabric bag they came with inside this case which is nice for those who want a little extra protection.\", 4964: \"Great case. The size is just right for my Crosshair 2.0 sunglasses. It's Stylish and has a good spring to it. It'll even pinch you if you're not carefull.\", 4965: 'This case looks and works great. I use it for my oakley oil rigs and they fit pretty snug. The case snaps closed pretty firmly and protects the lenses well', 4966: 'Love these glasses! The transaction was smooth and glasses shipped fast. No problems whatsoever! The only downfall is they were a little wider than I expected so I had to get them adjusted.', 4967: 'Very nice, looking cool and flexible to wear any time.', 4968: 'First, I never imagined myself as the kind of person who would wear Oakley glasses. I was never into sunglasses, so the brand never had any real appeal to me. But I kept an open mind when I was shopping for new frames last year and tried these on. I was very surprised by how much I liked them in terms of looks and comfort. I\\'ve had them for over 6 months now, and they\\'ve become my 2nd favorite pair of glasses - surpassed only by my recently-purchased Oakley \"Coin\" frames.They\\'ve been very good as far as staying on my head, but they were professionally fitted as I got them at a local optometrist shop. My only complaint is that they do tend to slide down my nose a bit whenever I get sweaty or greasy. They\\'ve never managed to fall off my head, though.Pros: great looks (subjective), comfortable, feel fairly sturdy, less expensive than many other \"designer\" frames.Cons: poor nose grip, rubber on temple pieces can slide off of the frame over time but is easily pushed back in place.', 4969: 'This is my third Oakley pack and probably my favorite.  Good size for daily use or overnight trips. Not too heavy like the kitchen sink, not as big as the ap.  love it!', 4970: 'Super comfortable shoes. Made of pure leather and latex rubber. Ideal for day to day. Can be used with semi-formal or sports clothes. High resistance to everyday use.', 4971: \"Not much to say other then they work.

I was wearing my contacts and after about 80 mph on the freeway I just happened to chk as I was going to left it up to get some air and it was up lol. I like these a lot already. I work offshore and they are Z87 good to go as well. All oakleys are. The Case that they come in is a little big for my tast but it would stop anything from crushing them and that's a good thing. Never had a pair of Shades that were more then $20 bux but I am glad I got these. I will never go back to the $20 shades ever again.\", 4972: 'Very comfi and fast shipping.

And the white has been thufar very easy to clean after a day on the course.', 4981: 'These make great boating shoes for REAL boat workers. We work on a metal vessel with some rino lining on it for 12+/- hours every day. The shoes grip WET metal or even (occasionally) oil covered. They can be completely soaked and either bead water off, or (if immersed for more than a couple seconds) dry exceptionally quick. The reason I give 4/5 stars is: you HAVE to get used to them first. It took me only a week, it could take longer for others. what is pictured in this ad is the drawstring going out the top eyes and down towards the toe on top. there is a pocket to tuck this in so it doesnt get in the way. the laces are not fully shown, they go between a top spandex-like material and another cloth. Tightening that does NOT pull the back in, it acts just as a normal shoe would. The toe is made of rubber that is much harder than normal water shoes, more like work boots except light. When the laces pull back it pushes the area above the heel, achilles area, against a fairly firm fabric. Which is the part I am referring to with the \"getting used to\". After a few hours for a couple days it causes severe chaffing and a blister to possibly form. After a week of that with me i wore socks for 2 days and i had nice little tougher areas (not callouses). Also the back fabric softened a little.All in all, if you actually WORK on a boat or are in constant water situations these are very exceptional shoes.Also note that I could not buy my size, i went a size up, this could in fact be the cause. However it also could be that no matter the size, they still need to be broken in. They are extremely rugged.', 4982: 'this is the best sandal that i have ever worn, when i buy another pair of sandals it will be another pair of these.', 4983: 'These glasses are just was I was looking for and a lot cheaper than I could find them locally.

When I received them they fit perfectly and within the first day of wearing them I've already gotten many compliments. If you are thinking about purchasing these I would say go for it because you will not be disappointed.\", 4996: 'I love these sunglasses. They are lightweight and very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.They are not my first choice if I am going to be in bright sunlight for extended periods of time. However, they work just fine in most circumstances.', 4997: 'This fit just like my previous pair, which is why I ordered them. I love these sunglasses!!! So many colors and choices!', 4998: \"These glasses look great, block the sun out amazingly, are light and fun BUT the frame is wide for a woman's face. I wish they made them a bit smaller.\", 4999: 'Oakley has always had the best colors of their lenses, these are pretty awesome and their new frogskins are very light weight on your head too.  Un-like the wayfarers which are bulky and heavy.  Great look!', 5000: \"Love the colors!! & the fit is great! Gotta love my Oakley's! I would def purchase another pair!! Enjoy yours!\", 5001: 'Small size, plastic. Sportive looking. I already knew the product so I was looking for specifically for this. Great item', 5002: 'Great item. Solid glass cover', 5003: 'At first I was expecting this not to be an actual Oakley case but took the risk and it was. I was highly surprised and a great case to store my new Oakley glasses!', 5004: \"I love this case. It's really big but I needed something that my Antix would fit in and this works. I can just throw this case in a backpack and not worry about my glasses being damaged.\", 5005: \"My husband has Oakley Fuel Cell sunglasses and this case is perfect for them.  The case is well made and very sturdy.  It also looks pretty cool.  The only down side is it's a bit bulky but because of the size of the glasses it almost has to be.  It is better then other cases because it will not bend or dent which means maximum protection for the sunglasses.  We are very happy with the product.\", 5006: 'Loved it.how much can one write about a sun glasses case?  Again, how much can one write about a sunglasses case?', 5007: 'Bought this to house my oakley twenty. Fits great. Its big and tough so no worries about it getting crushed in my backpack.', 5008: \"Have had my case for a couple months now. Have dropped it, and brought it everywhere and wouldn't use anything but it for my oil rigs. The oil rigs are the largest sunglasses you will fit in it though. Very happy with it.\", 5009: 'In need of a sunglasses case for your Oakley Half-Jackets? This is a perfect one! The cushioning inside this Oakley Vault is cut out exactly in the design of the sunglasses so they fit inside perfectly.The super soft foam inside also has slits cut out for storing additional lenses for your glasses. The case, while classified as semi-hard, is quite solid. You can sit on this case with your glasses in it and your glasses with be protected.The zipper slides smoothly and the everything about it feels just as high quality as Oakley glasses do themselves. Definitely a must have accessory to protect your glasses. This Vault is made specifically for the Half-Jacket and the Flack-Jacket by Oakley, so not all sunglass styles will fit.Highly recommended for those looking for an Oakley Half-Jacket or Flack-Jacket sunglasses case!', 5010: \"This is a great case and provides all the protection you could ever need for those crazy expensive Oakleys.  The one thing I was surprised was that this case is much bigger than the case for my M-Frame glasses and lenses.  If you are familiar with Oakleys you know the M-Frames are much, much bigger than the Flak Jackets.  Anyway, it is a great case but don't be surprised about the size of it.\", 5011: \"It's kind of bulky.  Protects well though.  I'm not sure how to do it, but I'm guessing the engineers could come up with something a little smaller that still protects well.\", 5012: \"The original case got stolen so i bought this as a replacement. It's a case and it does what it's supposed to. It's just like the first.\", 5013: \"Have been watching lots of online sites (I'm not allowed to mention which ones), but this is the place I found what I wanted at the best price!\", 5014: 'My husband loved them....and then loved them even more when he found out he could buy other lenses. He scratched them by stepping on them. The lenses were easy to replace. Awesome shades!', 5015: \"This glasses are so fashion, my client it's so happy with this buy, it was a Happy Valentine's gift, they loved it!!!\", 5016: 'I am very light sensitive due to have multiple eye surgeries and these are awesome! I would buy them again in a heartbeat. I have another pair of inexpensive sunglasses in my car for emergencies and can tell the difference. The Oakleys block more light. They are resilient; I wear them everywhere from driving to outdoors to the pool.', 5017: 'I love this shades! i have lost two pairs already but they are so comfortable and stylish i refuse to change. The best part is you can go to glass hut and have them adjusted for you.', 5018: \"Exactly what I wanted.  Converts my split jackets into wind jackets.  Great for wearing while engaged in motorsports.  keeps wind from making your eyes tear up and obscuring your vision.  High definition optics don't help if you can't see through them!  Gasket easily snaps in and out.  Strap is a good bit harder to remove and I fear it would get loose if applied and removed too many times.\", 5019: \"I purchased the Split jackets with Wind Gasket this spring. I am a competitive level cyclist on the road and mountain bikes. I love these sunglasses! They have done exactly what I needed, which is to protect my eyes from wind and elements. I have used them for short cross country races, 50+ mile mountain bike races, and crits, and they have worked perfectly for everything! The greatest thing about them is the wind gasket is not even noticeable when I have my bike helmet on, so no one notices that my Oakley's are any different from anyone elses. The wind gasket is super easy to pop in and out so my sunglasses can also be worn casually. I highly recommend these for cycling if you are looking for something to protect your eyes better from the elements.\", 5020: 'This tool is amazing it does what it is suppose to do. I race mountain biking and when im going fast it feels awesome not having those watery eyes. Thanks oakley!', 5021: \"I always drive at night with these and the only reason I had to dock a star, was because they're vented lenses and weren't quite advertised as such, but I got over it quickly.\", 5022: 'I found the Wind Gasket to be a incredible way to protect a dry or operated eye using your Split Jacket! This helped me to come back earlier to cycling!', 5023: \"Hi, when I purchased this sunglasses for my wife I really knew what to expect! I already use OAKLEY for more than 5 years and the optial quality is really outstanding giving you the confort of a clean image plus the filtering effects of a polarized lens. Only a person who weared a regular one and after that tried a polarized type, understands what I'm talking about. No other brand can compare with OAKLEY quality and confort and this not to mention the lightness of the frame!

I love this style because its different and not too expensive too.\", 5030: 'Got them for my wife as running sun glasses, dhe loves them.she says they stay put on her face and dont move', 5031: \"I like the iridium lenses that seem to reflect/block more sun light.  I have light colored eyes and they're very sensitive to light.  I've also had Lasik.  My old Oakley's were the Oil Can with smoke lenses and these seem to be superior.  They brighten up surroundings and are more light weight.  They also slightly wrap around my cheeks which blocks all light from getting around the bottom or sides.  I put them snug against my forehead which keeps sun out of the top.  One concern I have is that since they are white they may become dirty more easily.  The material feels soft and slightly porous.  I like the way they look on my square face and the white doesn't stand out too much either.\", 5032: 'Regrettably, someone broke into my truck and stole my work bag with my Oakley Monster Dogs amongst other items in the bag. The Monster Dogs have been my &#34;go-to&#34; glasses for years and was dissappointed to find out they have been discontinued.

I got them at US Standard Issue. They are heavily discounted for anybody in the tmilitary, police, fire/rescue, ems, FBI, Secret Service personel.

The sunglasses fits very well although there is an Asian Fit and I'm an Asian just for the info. Won't think that there'll be a difference with the Asian fit at all. Most importantly, the price that I got was way cheaper than the retail price online and the shops that are selling them. Highly recommended.\", 5037: \"I love these sunglasses! They are far more comfortable than my Oakley's Half Jackets, probably because I have a rather large head. They provide a nice comfy fit and adequate sun protection. Note: I did get the crystal black frames, which is NOT polarized, but that isn't a huge deal for me, unlike some other people.\", 5038: 'well made and gorgeous! They were avaliable at a good price and are good quality. I would purchase them again and they arrived on time.', 5039: \"Nice sunglasses but beware some are NOT POLARIZED as listed.When I purchased these Amazon had nine different pairs listed as Oakley Men's Pit Bull Polarized Sunglasses, Oakley's website only list six pairs polarized. maybe oakley does not have some in stock? Anyway, the ones I bought were not polarized. Hopefully Amazon will have corrected this by the time you read this.I bought the Crystal Black Frame/Black Iridium Lens from the list and the item description says polarized but they are not. Oakley actually prints POLARIZED on bottom of the left lens, right if you are looking at them. If you go to the Oakley official site you will notice some colorways are not offered polarized. (I should have before I purchased).Here's the list when I checked it out...Not PolarizedSKU#OO9127-01 Brown Tortoise w/Dark BronzeSKU#OO9127-02 Crystal Black w/Black Iridium - (the ones I purchased)SKU#OO9127-03 Gunmetal FMJ w/Fire IridiumSKU#OO9127-04 Matte Black w/Warm GreyPolarizedSKU#OO9127-05 Metallic Black w/OO Black Iridium PolarizedSKU#OO9127-06 Polished Black w/Black Iridium PolarizedSKU#OO9127-07 Matte White w/OO Red Iridium PolarizedSKU#OO9127-08 Polished Rootbeer w/Tungsten Iridium PolarizedNot sure about these two as they were listed at one time.SKU#OO9127-09 Polished Black w/Deep Blue PolarizedSKU#OO9127-10 Polished Black w/Shallow Blue PolarizedAgain, don't know how accurate that list is but the ones I purchased listed as polarized were not.I like mine and may keep them anyway and use my Fuel Cell polarized pair for when I'm on the water. These are one of Oakleys newest release (April 2011.Please be aware the item description says - Face Size: large. These are slightly larger than my Fuel Cell's. It seems the trend with Oakley lately is to go bigger lens and frames.If you like the style and need a pair of sunglasses that will stay on your head (Nose /Temple Pads) while active then these just may be the right ones for you. They are large as stated before but fit my head nicely, light weight and comfortable. Good eye protection as you know Oakley lenses will not shatter.  The Polarized may be your best choice but they do have a few drawbacks such as not being able to read LCD displays, GPS, Radio display, Cell Phone, etc. Some people complain the polarized have a rainbow effect when looking through clear or tinted windows or shield. Also some motorcyclist prefer the non-polarized because they can see oil slicks on the road better as the polarized diminish the glare of the oil slick.Also be sure of what color of lens you choose because it makes a big difference. Here's an article you may like to read about it. - Choosing the Best Sunglass Lens Color[..]Overall I'm still not sure Oakleys are worth the price difference of a nice $20 or $30 pair of polarized sunglasses.

Brought these after a friend let me try on his. They fit well and completely, no light gets in around the edges and the lenses don't distort your vision.\", 5042: \"I love this pair - tried at the retail store and purchased from Amazon. The order (Crystal Black Frame/Black Iridium Lens) says it is polarized but from Oakley, it is NOT polarized. Amazon's product description on my order is somehow misleading.The either side will come off if pressed hard - so be aware. Also no replacement lens are made available from Oakley yet at this point - so do NOT scratch. Unfortunately, I accidentally scratched the left lens in Antelope Canyon a week ago - have to wait or find a replacement of some kind.Nevertheless, this is an excellent pair from Oakley...but would certainly pay more attention next time and make sure I will get a polarized one.\", 5043: \"These are nice sunglasses but they are ginormous. I have a large head and face and they were too big for my personal preference so I'll be returning. Just wanted to mention the size as some others have. Otherwise great Oakley product as always.\", 5044: 'The Oakley Pit Bull shades are really awesome.  I got the crystal black frames with the black iridium lens.  They are light weight and the lens filters out almost all the uv rays.  I would strongly recommend them to anyone who wants some stylish shades especially if you have a large face.  It is a great buy for the money.', 5045: \"I rate this a 5 star because the product was exactly what I wanted, but it was just a little big for me. I've bought oakleys before and this is by far the best service. The lenses was great, just to wide.\", 5046: \"I had my previous pair of Oakley's for about 8 years and have been really happy with them.  Recently the film on the lenses started to peal real bad.  Decided to replace them with the Oakley Pit Bull and I think I made the right decision.  They're very well made and fit comfortably.  I got the Crystal Black Frame/Black Iridium Lens ($93).  The tint is not as dark as I would have liked, sometimes I can't even tell I have them on.  But when I take them off I can really tell the difference.  So it's not a huge deal.  Overall I'm extremely pleased and won't own sunglasses other than Oakley!\", 5047: \"it's inter fit. purchase carefully! and it's big lens. but good price 86usd. but not asian fit so i  had to sell it .\", 5048: \"I paid almost half the retail price for these shades, which is about $180 from my comparison shopping. Sure you can get other off-brand polarized sunglasses way cheaper, but I've found that often, value and price go hand in hand and you can get the best of both with a little comparison shopping and the willingness to pay a bit more for the quality. This purchase has proved the wisdom of that philosophy for me, again.I like to put my glasses on top of my head when not using them and wanted a pair that would grip my head and not slip off. The shape, design, lightness (which concerned me at first) and rubberized surfaces on these frames accomplished that requirement perfectly.I ordered these because I help coach my son's Special Olympic Snowshoe team and needed something for the state finals. These arrived ahead of schedule (as usual with Amazon) and I gave them a good testing in the bright sun and snow. They were so light, comfortable and wrapped around so well, I often forgot that I was wearing them!

They are polarized.. block out the sun good. I love the red color. . I would purchase again. very good price for being oakleys.... arrived in timely fashion. were packaged well...', 5052: 'Great glasses that block the sun from all angles. Comfortable and durable. A great value for the price. Good buy', 5053: \"I like that there are rubber grips to stay on your nose better. They feel well made and hopefully will last a while. One minor thing is that the word polarized is at the bottom of one of the lenses and you can kind of see it while wearing them. It doesn't bother me that much though.\", 5054: 'I LOVE Oakley!! And I love these!! But I initially had the Fireworks color, and it just did not work for my own coloring. I have deep vibrant red hair and really warm skin coloring, and these just looked weird because they have such a prominent blue undertone. The Brown Sugar ones are spectacular though!! My husband would always comment when I wore the Fireworks ones, saying they were too big for my face or something. But when I put on the Brown Sugar ones he says they look super stylie! Lol! Anyway, great glasses as always, cuz Oakley ROCKS!!!!', 5055: 'I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new Oakleys!!! They fit PERFECT!!!I love the RED!! And the best part is the QUALITY.

I'm delighted with this purchase - love these glasses!!\", 5057: \"I picked this pair because I keep losing the black rubber nose pads of my previous style of Oakleys, even after purchasing a replacement kit and attempting to Gorilla glue them in-place.  This pair has the nose pad more integrated into the frame.  What I found even more of a pleasant surprise is the way they hug my face and don't allow sunlight in from above, as in driving with the sunroof open!  These pair fit me like a glove!  Absolutely love them!!!  And yes, the famous Oakley polarized lens is still there!\", 5058: 'They are defiantly attention getters, I love that because I love RED everything! They only disappointment was no cleaning cloth..', 5059: 'I thought the glasses were perfect (product wise), however, they did not look good on my shape of face. The fit was nice also.

I never thought I would pay this much for a pair of sunglasses, but these are very nice. Comfortable, stylish, and functional.', 5061: 'Great clarity with good eye protection. They are not completely wraparound. Some light does get in from the bottom, but it is minimal.', 5062: 'Looks elegant, but I am not satisfied how light is the lenses. Definitely, I prefer dark colors lenses, like black or kind of degrade dark brown. Still bright light!', 5063: 'Nice sunglasses, good quality. Like them much better than oakley wires. very comfortable. The glasses seem to be much more durable than me previous wires pair.

She likes to wear glasses of different kinds.First the brand name made her to wear the glasses a couple of times, then she began liking it pretty much.

No matter the season, they do their job, protect me from the wind and sun.', 5087: 'To start off, i have never purchased sunglasses before, let alone Oakleys. When the package arrived, i was pleasantly surprised at how attractive these shades were. Not only was the packaging excellent and attractive but they also came with complementary cleaning chamois and cleaner, with 2 additional lenses. As soon as i took my car out for a spin, i could tell instantly how effective these glasses were at reducing glare and how \"bright\" everything is when i took the shades off. Oakley definitely doesn\\'t fail to impress, excellent product.', 5088: 'They very comfortable glasses.  The lens are very clear and absolutely cut down the glare on very bright days.  I would definately recommend them.', 5089: \"Hello all,The reviews are positive, and rightly so. I wanted to verify that as someone who keeps two pair of these, I can verify these are the same as the retail stores. I bought once at an Oakley store, and these were exactly the same item. From that angle, buy with confidence. You aren't missing out on anything with the discount.\", 5090: 'I have several pair of Oakley.  The most recent pair that I bought I saw on an Olympic athlete.

One reviewer was good enough to point out the way to identify whether you would receive the polarized lens versioin, if the original list price showed $280, and the seller was Amazon, you were getting polarized. I took that advise and found it spot on, I did receive the polarized black iridium lens, with the additional, non polarized persimmon lenses.These glasses have proven outstanding on the golf course, while driving, and in every situation so far. I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a great, and versatile, pair of glasses.', 5094: 'I write this with mixed feelings about this recent purchase.  I guess the expression \"you get what you pay for\" holds true here.  I recently purchased the Polished Black frame with Black Polarized Iridium/Persimmon lenses.  First of all, yes, these lenses are indeed polarized, despite the ambiguous description.  I have an old Oakley Spike polarized to compare and to me, for some reason, the polarization on the Fast Jacket seems \"lighter\" or less noticeable then my Spike.  This is a good thing for me.  I rarely wear my Oakely Spike because the polarization was very noticeable and it bothered me.  In any case when I received the Fast Jacket the first time, the Oakleys came in a black box.  Inside you\\'ll find a few pieces of paper for instructions, warranty, etc.  and the case containing the sunglasses.  The glasses looked great and I was initially pleased.  However, I noticed it was missing the Oakley Nano-Clear Hydrophobic Mini-Pen and cloth kit that Oakley website describes as being standard accessories.  All I got was the case, the sunglasses, an extra nose piece pair, the cool looking designer micro fiber bag for the glasses, and the extra set of lenses.  So I arranged for an exchange thinking perhaps the kit fell out or whatever.  Second pair came in a different box with black and white design.  I\\'ve seen this box on many review web sites and thought maybe this is it.  To my dismay I open to find the same thing - everything except the hyrophobic cleaning kit.  I looked at the boxes to figure out why they were different.  One thing that I noticed which bothered me was that the black box had a copyright date of 2012 whereas the black and white box had 2011!  So were the ones I just received last year\\'s model?  As far as I can tell, the actual items are the same.  But why are the boxes different?  Is Amazon recycling boxes or recycling returns?  Don\\'t get me wrong the glasses themselves seem pristine to me as far as I can tell and I\\'m pretty OCD anal about these things.  Based on some of the other reviews it seems there\\'s minor inconsistencies with the product.  For one of Oakley\\'s top premium sunglassess that retails at $280, I expect to get everything that\\'s suppose to come with it, i.e. the same that you would get from an Oakely store.  But.. I didn\\'t pay full price for these.  Since I\\'m not a collector, I\\'ve decided to keep a pair because the interchangeable lens system is interesting and it was cheap enough for me to look over the missing items.  So you get what you pay for.  If you\\'re the kind of person that wants everything the way it\\'s sold at an Oakley store or a collector that cares about original boxes, etc.  You can take the time to see if you get what you want with Amazon\\'s great return policy.  I never have believed Amazon to recycle their returns but I can\\'t explain why I got two different boxes with different dates.  Again the glasses are legit and high quality (my 5th pair of Oakleys) but just don\\'t pay full price for them.  Hope this helps answer some questions.', 5095: 'Great fit and legit Oakleys. You cannot beat the amazon pricing (paid $175) and it fits and feels exactly like the ones you would pay full price for in stores.Highly recommend!', 5096: 'I love Oakley sunglasses and this new frame is great.  The lens are amazingly clear.  They come with a low light persimmons pair of lenses, hard cover and soft cover.', 5097: 'Whatever problems other reviews have stated with the frame not being straight are not an issue anymore. These are great looking light weight sport glasses that can be used for almost any situation thanks to the changeable lenses. They are comfortable and work. They are worth the $160 amazon is selling them for, but not the $280 Oakley is selling them for.', 5098: 'The sunglasses look sharp. lighter in weight than i thought. they are great for driving. i like the style. overall a great purchase. arrived in a timely manner.', 5099: \"Christmas present for my son in law and he loves them! He's also a panthers fan and these are their colors!\", 5100: 'the glasses are great and fit great and quality made. the transition lens are very cool but they never get really dark, if it is very bright out or driving into the sun they do not work very well.', 5101: 'These glasses are awesome.  I purchased the Fast Jacket Polarized Oval with the black frames after much research.  I purchased them for 1/2 the price every other store wanted.  They are awesome but not sure if I would pay full price.  For the price I paid I am very happy.', 5102: \"These glasses are AWESOME!  Don't expect me to tell you the difference between high-quality, perfectly engineered, Oakley sunglasses and Wally-World, $13 cheap-o's.  You can read the Oakley website for that[...]. These glasses are exactly as described there.  What I can say is that Amazon has an outstanding price compared to the retail price of $280.  Originally, I picked mine up at a retailer at the mall and paid $296.80 after tax.  Here at Amazon, I saved over 46% and paid $159.10!!!  Needless to say, the mall store took there's back.  Thanks Amazon!EDIT 07/10/2013I have had these glasses now for well over a year and guess what? I still LOVE them! I have put these through a lot and they still look great. My lenses are still in perfect condition too.Side note about Walleva Polarized Titanium + Black Lenses:I did purchase some Walleva Polarized Titanium + Black Lenses to change things up and as I should have expected; JUNK. Pay the money and get REAL Oakley lenses! What I truly did NOT expect was that the Walleva lenses did not quite fill the frame's socket and actually left the frames feeling weak and flimsy. Not to mention the Walleva lenses were not very nice to look though either. Polarization was off from right eye to left eye . I didn't like the clarity through them; everything seemed cloudy to me.\", 5103: 'It was magnificent for me and I really love it so much good brand and shape.....thanks for amazon and customer review it helps me a lot', 5104: \"This is my second pair of Oakley. This fits better for me than the XLJ's I first bought (I say I have a small to medium face/head size). Lens are polarized as advertised. Easy to change lenses.  There is nothing not to like except if you buy it at regular price. As usual, need to take care of those lenses because they can easily scratch.\", 5105: 'I was looking for light weight, plastic frame, switchable lenses and wide coverage from sun.  The Fast Jacket do it all.  I own 2 pairs of the Oakley Wires, but do a lot of driving and wanted something lighter and that could handle all weather conditions.  You can switch the lens quickly and it fits firmly in the frame.  No lens jiggle and you can switch as much as you like without worrying about the lens closure wearing out.  I have had these for over a month and wear them everyday. Great sunglasses.', 5106: \"This is my 5th pair of Oakleys and by far my favorite.  They look great, fit great and the Black Iridium lens is great for bright sunlight.  I also own a few pair of Raidar,a pair of flack jacket and fives squared which I dearly love as well.  These are by far the best all-around fit and lens in my Oakley collection.  My only beef with Oakley is the lens scratch easily.  I found this same pair at a local outfitter's store for $280 so I knew I had to try these at over $100 savings.  I also love the idea that the lens interchange so easily.\", 5107: 'Having gone to various physical locations and inspected, tugged, worn and manipulated a variety of sunglasses across different brands I settled for these. The $132+ I paid for the pair of Polished Black framed HD Polarized Fast Jacket with Black Iridium/Persimmon Lens is the absolute best price that I found both online and at all physical locations that I visted up to and including the manufacturers store fronts and their online site. The actual Item was perfect in construction, fit, feel, balance and ease at swapping the replacement nose pads and the additional Persimmon lens that were included. The included Nano-Clear Hydrophobic Pen/Marker was easy to use and had the advertized effect of coating the lens maitaining its \"soil free\" properties. The lens cleaning cloth and the electrostatic Microclear bag both serve their intended purpose. This item has performed better than expected thus far and is an all round solid product even for the higher prices found elsewhere so to acquire these at this low price is just a no brainer.', 5108: 'Was very exited to find these on Amazon at this price,,,same item as found in retail sunglasses store, spare lenses etc,', 5109: 'These are great sunglasses for pretty much anything.  They look great, polarized lenses are a must for sunny days, and they fit the head as well as any pair of sunglasses I have ever owned.  The one downside is the fairly high price tag, but quality has a cost.  The new inter-changable lens system is a good upgrade from the flak jacket series.  Overall these are very high quality sunglasses that are good for everything from golf to bicycle riding to just wearing around town.', 5110: 'I was on sale when i bought it. It is polarized with two oragnge lenses that are exchangable. Love the slick design and look hansome when i go out.', 5111: \"With a price so low, I had some concerns about the authenticity of these glasses, but they arrived and everything checked out! No damage, they don't appear to be seconds, and they fit and feel just like at the store! So far, they've been great and have met my expectations as a long-time Oakley customer. (I've owned at least six pairs in the last eleven years, and all of them are either still with me or had been lost/stolen.) Fit and finish of the materials is excellent, and the locking mechanism feels solid. I had to swap out the nose pieces (larger ones are included in the package) in order to get the lenses far enough from my eyelashes, but it was easy to do. I'll follow up on how they've fared after a few months, but so far, I'm very happy with this purchase. My only caveat is this: My pair did not come with the NanoClear cleaner pen. I'm kinda bummed about it, but I don't want to send my glasses back in, so I'll just pay the $15 down the road to buy the cleaning kit.Included:Black polarized lenses with black framesPersimmon (orange) lensesHard caseSoft bagReplacement nose pieces (larger size)Sept 2013 update:These glasses are still doing great! Many miles on the bike and run with these glasses with both lenses, and they're still scratch-free. The mechanism can lock up a bit, presumably from the sweat, and I'm sometimes worried I might rip one of the earpieces off the frame trying to unfasten the lenses, but so far so good. I rinse them with a drop of dish soap whenever they get oily, but they still shed water readily. I've only had fogging issues once during the run of a triathlon where it had been misting rain all morning in the high 80s F.\", 5112: 'The gun-metal with the fire iridium made the glasses stand out.  The fit is right for my somewhat large head.', 5113: \"Very Nice...Fits my big head.  I'm the envy of my cycling club with the Red Iridium Lens.  The arms have come slightly loose, but was easy to tighten up.\", 5114: 'Also own a white pair, these were the second set I grabbed. Extremely comfortable, zero slippage at the ear pieces, and reasonably scratch resistant.', 5115: 'I have always loved Oakley glasses and these are no exception. Fit well, block brightness while still allowing you to see clearly for driving and other activities. And they look good too! Not a huge fan of the latest style of big huge lenses, but these are a good compromise, look good, feel comfortable and were a great price.', 5116: 'Great fashion, fit and function at a good price! My new favorite sunglasses. Shipping was fast and the price was fair, I can recommend these for all.', 5117: 'Have been looking for a replacment for the (frogskin 2)frame for the last several years and this is it a large wide frame big, big big great fit from the moment I slid them on over the weekend I have been in heaven. great raparound fit, only request would be that they had two models one with Unobtainium pads and one without.

Definitely worth the money.', 5121: 'I LOVE IT', 5122: 'I ordered these as some of the other like the Half Jacket were too tight on my appropriately proportioned head.

They're edgy enough to go casual, but also look good with his suits for work.  Great looking!\", 5124: 'This is my first polarized glasses, and I will never get a non-polarized glasses again. And of course since it is an Oakley, it has good quality.', 5125: 'These glasses look great and are very comfortable. I would highly recommend them. I use them mostly for fishing.

The price was awesome!', 5128: \"I got the first pair a month ago and found it's right side temple was very loose. I returned it and got the refund. I bought another 2 pairs, one for myself and one for my brother. Still had the problem of loose temple on the right side. The frame quality of this model was not as good as the other Oakley I have.Great lens fits well and very comfortable. My size is in between medium to large. I found most medium were too tight and large would be a bit loose. The Pit Bull fits perfectly.\", 5129: 'Bought these for my son off his wish list. He loves them.  Shape, fit, clarity are fabulous.

I have a larger head (7 3/4 in hat size) the fit is very tight, but is the case with most glasses.  I would recommend these to a friend.', 5134: 'The shades give you fantastic optical clarity! The lens has a light amber tint that sharpens images, and still provides excellent polarized protection for your eyes.', 5135: \"Purchased the Oakley Men's Eyepatch Square Sunglasses as a christmas gift for my husband.  He's a big guy and has a big face/head.  Reviews said these fit big guys well and they do.  My husband loves them - not too snug but fits his face well.  He also loves the lens tent - said it makes his eyes go &#34;ahhhh&#34; when he puts them on.\", 5136: 'Great safety glasses; Z80 rated. I get complements on them all the time.

I was buying Spy and Von Zipper instead. I forgot the high quality of Oakley!!! These are the best glasses I have ever owned bar none!! The quality of oakley's have no equal!!

Can't wait for my another piece of this one\", 5144: \"Excellent shades with extreme coverage and perfect for larger faces.  These are probably the 1st truly, large-XL fit sunglasses advertised on the whole market of high end, stylish Shades. Out of the dozens of premium shades I've owned in my life, these fit the bill and I'm so pleased with the fit, I wish they came out years go. So if you've had problems finding shades that fit due to a large head/face these will make you extremely happy.  They are extremely light weight, do not feel cheap, very sturdy and well made with the quality one would expect from Oakley. But if you have a small or medium face/head these probably would not suit your needs, and not fit properly. Medium/large and large heads/faces would be the only suitable canidates I believe. Keep in mind I think these are the largest shades Oakley currently or ever have produces besides possibly some of the blade (single lens) styles. I'm even going to get a couple more pairs in other color combinations, I enjoy them that much. I hope this reveiw will prove useful for anyone interested in purchasing Eyepatch 2's and for those looking for a truly large frame that is in fact large!\", 5145: \"These do a great job blocking out light from around the frames. I love the polarized lens. I realized the cost is less that the store, probably because there is no hard case, but the bag is perfect from preventing scratches when I'm not wearing them.\", 5146: \"Purchased over 4 months back when Amazon was having $20 off select sunglasses and happy with the purchase.  Love the fact that it is plastic frame - much lighter than my previous Oakley which was all metal frame.

Very pleased with this style of Oakleys.', 5148: \"Edit Edit Edit, just changed it from 4 stars to 5.  After wearing these for weeks I have determined they are just about the most comfortable sun glasses ever.  And it is cool you can find replacement lenses as well.  So, Oakley could make these a litle better IMO, however the fit is outstanding.  No little red line on the nose at all, even after long hikes and wearing them all day.  So Eye Patch gets 5 stars BABY!What I don't like-Kinda cheap and light framedFrame seams a little sharpish at the edgesWhat I like-Monster Glasses, large on the faceNice big and smooth on the nose, huge for the comfort of long tripsLenses are perfect and even better can be replaced cheaply if you scratch themedit- yes these aren't polarized but you can buy replacement lenses when you were these lenses out.  These are tied for my favorite sun glasses ever with gargoyles.  They would easily be my favorite if oakley made the frames better.\", 5149: \"Okay, now let me preface this by saying I've got a big face/head. I'm not a huge guy, but I've got a wide face which makes it close to impossible to find a pair of good sunglasses that fit. I was going to buy the Oakley GasCans, but thank God I went to the Sunglass Hut first to try them on because they were too small for me. The guy there told me to try the Eyepatch 2 as they were the best fit for guys with a wide face and I'm glad I tried them. They are comfortable and they look sharp.

The oakley icons are purple. i like these enough that i will not spend more then needed to get real legit oakleys. these are real. you cant see your eyes at all. the packaging is a oakley box with warranty, and lenses options. the sunglasses come with a special microfiber bag to clean the lenses. they are great. id say get them it is worth it. the black ones are the only ones i can confirm as real. the brown ones i can agree bc you can get theme custom on the oakley website. but i have never seen the clear, purple ones.', 5152: 'Great fitting glasses with great optics.  They are a little bigger than I expected but that is OK because I mainly wanted them for riding my Harley.  Will protect my eyes and improve vision with the polarized lenses.', 5153: 'So not only did my boyfriend LOVE these glasses based on the form, fit, function and style.  He recently had the glasses drop out of his pocket in the middle of a street.  When we finally found them, they were in four pieces after being run over.  He easily put them back together and found there was only a scratch or two on the frame.  Unbelievable!!!  I really feel these are a great value.', 5154: 'I was looking for some new shades, after i came across these, I didnt need to search any further. Hopefully I can get another pair!!!', 5155: \"These sunglasses are relatively huge. I wear a 7 3/4 baseball cap, and have a proportional big 'ol face. These fit me nicely. I cannot imagine these would work for many women, or dude's with smaller faces. They have awesome lenses that are appropriate for various light conditions. I wore them in the Bahamas and in central Texas in December and January and despite a big difference in relative light they were great for both. I like that you don't have to take them off in most low-light conditions. Great glasses.\", 5156: 'I am happy with this sunglasses, great fit... better than my old oakley model (fuel cell) on my personal opinion. Thanks very much.', 5157: \"I was a locs fan for years but recently broke my last uncomfortable pair of cheap sunglasses at that time I pledged to replace them with a pair of good moderately priced sunglasses of a similar design.  After about 3 days of searching the net I came across the eyepatch2 model and decided to give them a try and I couldn't be happier that I did. I'm a creature of habit so I purchased them in matte black and the brown/ root beer color and I'm equally satisfied with both pair. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for larger sunglasses.\", 5158: 'Excellent fit for larger faces.  Comfortable and great clarity.  Much lighter than my Ray Bans and considerably cheaper than other glasses I have bought.', 5159: 'Very nice glasses.  I have a larger face and these glasses fit perfect.

Someone in the bus asked me if I can see very well because he couldn't see my eyes but the mirror like lens were very cool.Light frame but fits snug on face and quality is good. Lenses are clear, wide and polarized, I feel it protects my eyes from the sun very well.Five stars if it had a hard case instead of the Oakley pouch as its container because this style is larger than regular sunglasses and it doesn't fit in those built in sunglasses compartment in cars, so a hard case with the product would help in its &#34;longevity&#34;, But the shades were okay for the price, I would recommend it for people who have a casual /sporty personality and prefer an Oakley non metal type sunglasses.

Overall, though, I am very happy with these sunglasses.\", 5176: \"I actually own the original Oakley Eyepatch glasses not the new ones advertised here. Well why are you writing a review then? Because I have owned them and used them 'heavily' for over a year now and I want to touch upon their durability.I do not take care of my sunglasses. I throw them in the drawer, in my tight pocket or wherever else is convenient at the time. Usually my glasses get lost or stolen before they break but I have managed to hold onto these for more than a year now. Without a question, these glasses are made to last. They are a very solid design. Apart from the aforementioned abuse I often drop them. They slip off my head when I am wearing them backwards, they slip out of my hands or off things that I have put them on. This does not seem to phase the Eyepatch one bit. They have a few scratches from hitting the concrete but otherwise are A ok.Even the lenses seem to take some dedicated effort to scratch. This is impressive considering the sheer size of the lenses. These glasses block out everything and let very little sunlight in.

I got the polished black / violet iridium lenses.  I owned 2 pairs of the original eyepatch and I like these even better.  I am a big dude and these fit me well and I get no light bleeding in from the sides.  They provide total coverage and the lenses are the perfect tint for me. They aren't as harshly angular as the eyepatch 1 which is good.  Overall a great buy and I would highly recommend them!\", 5183: \"I love these frames, they not only provide a crisp view but they cover my entire plain of view and no sun is sneaking in. I have a large cranium and it is tough finding a set of shades that look good and fit good on my squash but these Oaks do the trick. If you have a melon head then search no more cause these Eyepatch 2's are a perfect match. I love the violet iridium lenses and the High Def optics are beautiful. And to those boneheads that are complaining that these aren't polarized well my advice is to read. If you know anything about Oakleys then you know Polarized lenses will add at least another 40-50 dollars to regular set ups and nowhere in the world besides Standard Issue will you find them for less. Use your noodle when ordering and don't blame the seller.\", 5184: 'Very pleased with this product. Larger frames fit great and the blue fade gets tons of compliments. I would recommend these oaks to any1. Also picked up the blue iridium lenses to finish off the look.....amazon is great! Saved me $.', 5185: \"With Oakley, you know what you're getting. Aggressive style and solid function. The Eyepatch 2 has both in spades. These are huge - HUGE - sunglasses. It fits a big head well but could overwhelm many. They're also a bit heavy, though for their size, they are light. The iridium lenses take a bit of getting used to, but they function well and no one does clear vision better than Oakley. There's no unobtanium to keep them from sliding when sweaty, which is my only real complaint.\", 5186: 'I love them. These sunglasses are comfortable and look great. The style is sporty but at the same time classy.

The supply of factory Oakley and aftermarket lenses is great. The G30 lens for golf is great in anything but direct sunlight ( my eyes are very sensitive).

Hence the purchase of a new pair together with a further pair for my son.We both love the glasses as they are extremely well made, look great and more importantly do the job they were designed to do protect your eyesight.The only unfortunate side of the whole thing was Oakley's stupid attitude to the situation that I wanted to add separate sets of G30 polaroid lenses to the order (G30 std./Persimmon lenses) and they wouldn't be party to this simple for the reason that I wanted them delivered along with the glasses I had purchased from Amazon to Australia with the weak excuse that I needed a U.S. based credit card which I have and paid Amazon for the two pair of glasses with (my billing address is in Australia after having worked and lived in the U.S for some 25+ years) and wasn't prepared to be ripped off by the Australian Oakley stores where the same US$95.00 price for lenses they we asking for AU$180.00 (with the exchange of the Australian dollar valued at 10% less than parity). Certainly left a nasty taste on the whole deal. Amazon should provide for be able to purchase additional lenses for the glasses through them rather than having to deal through Oakley who charge totally unreasonable shipping fees for extremely small 3&#34;x3&#34;x2&#34; boxes containing the lenses overseas (if you could do so) and expecting customers to bear the brunt of unscrupulous Oakley stores outside the U.S.Wake up Oakley, I should have thought your name is worth more than bad publicity for basic chump change. Amazon I should think you would also benefit from having change-over lenses available for customers having purchased Oakley products from you.\", 5199: \"I ended up returning these because I didn't like the way they looked on me, but I have no complaints about them. They are very solid frames, with lens quality you'd come to expect from Oakley. These in particular don't have polarized lenses, so you can get away with spending a little less, but you will notice a big difference when compared to polarized lenses. For me, polarization is worth the extra money, but to each his own.\", 5200: 'Good fit, nice optics, finally found some sunglasses that I really like. Bought a second pair for convenience - worth it to me.', 5201: 'This is my second time writing my review on this product from Amazon. My first one was blocked for no apparent reason! I suppose they don\\'t want people knowing the truth.The item description and pictures of this product all say and show \"Polarized\" but when you actually go and place the order, you receive the NON-polarized version. After reading Ros\\'s review, I was very hesitant in placing my order for these. Sure the price is unbeatable but you\\'re not getting the item you think you are! Because of this I talked to Amazon twice before placing my order. Both times I was assured and guaranteed that I would in fact receive the correct version of the item. I placed my order, waited and received a package with the wrong item in it, just like Ros.Now I wrote a different negative review last night, when I received the package that Amazon would not publish. I have since talked to Amazon and they are supposedly sending me another package with the correct item. Let\\'s see if this actually happens. If so, I will come back here and update this post. I\\'m not one to write bad reviews but after this problem has occured in the past, I would think Amazon would\\'ve fixed the issue. I give credit where credit is due and the same where it is not.***REVIEW REVISION: After returning and receiving two shipments with the incorrect product, I have received the third package tonight (11/15/11) and have finally gotten the correct version of this item. I am therefore changing my 1-star rating to a rounded up 4: 5 stars for the product itself and 2 for Amazon\\'s repeated misadvertised representation of the item and overall lack of knowledge on it by their customer support team. I have finally found the obscure solution on my own. Please read, I will shed some light on this..When I first placed my order on Amazon, the Oakley Fast Jacket XL Polarized (Black/black iridium) were available as being sold and shipped by Amazon; I have never trusted other sellers having a legitimate product. I always narrow my searches as seller:Amazon. I read the reviews, contacted Amazon and was given a guarantee to receive the correct item. I therefore placed the order and a few days later received a package with the non-polarized version of these glasses. I called Amazon, they apologized for the inconvenience and started the first replacement process for me. I was to send the incorrect item back with the preprinted return label. I waited for the replacement and when it came, again, it was the wrong item. However this time, the replacement was a USED pair of sunglasses! Oily residue all over the inner lens with eyebrow marks at the top of the lens and smudged outer lens and frame. I sent those back and contacted Amazon again, this time with my utmost frustration for having sent me someone\\'s used sunglasses. I talked to probably three other reps and kept going in circles with them, offering me a refund or replacement for \"probably the incorrect item again.\" I spoke to another rep who was to start an investigation process to check the actual item in the warehouse against the description on the site. He never called me back. I called Amazon again, same story. Having a fair amount of knowledge on Oakley products, I finally found what was happening and solved my own problem.Amazon has the main listing as \"Oakley Fast Jacket XL Polarized\" and several variations/color models of the item in the lower boxes. When you click on these, the pictures and prices change. That\\'s the trick..looking on Oakley.com I found that some of these models are not offered in polarized versions of the -XL- at all (ie. sky blue and lemon peel models). Yet Amazon has them all listed under the main polarized heading having you believe they are all polarized. If you click on these and purchase them, you are guaranteed to get a non-polarized set. Where Amazon gets confused and misleading is there are both polarized and non-polarized versions of some models. Now going further, the MAIN thing to look at to ensure you are ordering the correct model is the ORIGINAL RETAIL price that\\'s crossed out. There are two prices only: $220 original price is for all NON-polarized versions, $280 is the polarized. If you order based on original Oakley retail price, you will receive the correct item. The Amazon ASIN number stays the same across the board which makes it very confusing if you look further into it. However, based on the original price if you order knowing what I mentioned, you will get the right sunglasses! I have further researched this on their site and there are several other Oakley models with the same problem:listed as polarized with the incorrect original price. I bet you if you order them, you will receive the wrong item! Amazon has NO CLUE as to this and they\\'re apparently not payed to know. I\\'m sorry but when I\\'m spending $200+ on sunglasses I expect a favorable result.Having said all this, I will conclude saying that I have always been extremely satisfied with Amazon\\'s prices and shipping.. their customer service though is seemingly there for no other reason than to say nice words and make us feel better, while not offering a solution at all. I hope this review can help other potential buyers out there save some very valuable time and money in the process. The prices are unbeatable, if you know what you\\'re buying. \"Caveat emptor.\"', 5202: 'I ordered the Black Ird/Persimmmon (no polarization)for Christmas 2012. I read all the reviews for this product and was a little leary about ordering due to some of the past experiences.  The prices was very nice so I took a chance.  The frames and both lens are as advertised.  Of course the Fast Jacket lens changing mechanism is so simply and works flawlessly.  I would definitely recommend.', 5203: 'Read the other reviews, but they are skewed because apparently the product desired was the \"polarized\" version, while the actual item was not.Anyway, these sunglasses feel very nice fitting, especially after I changed the nosepads to the larger ones.  They sit at the right height, feel secure,and are fairly lightweight even with the added pieces for quick changing of the lenses.  The blue iridium lenses are awesome, displaying a medium-blue tinge to the rosy-brown background  (at least that\\'s how I view it, lol).  These lenses really \"pop\", fashion-wise.  The silver frame contrasts nicely and adds to the look.  You also get a 2nd lens set, this one has the jade iridium, which is equally eye-catching.  The XL lens size covers more area and will be nice for cycling, if I need a change from my other Oakleys.These sunglasses will look great on the golf course, cycling, daily wear, and even at a formal event.  Sweet!', 5204: 'I found these glasses while out on a shopping adventure with my wife, but did not want to spend $280 on them - found them here for a much more reasonable price - the fit great and look great - thanks!', 5205: \"I really love these glasses.  They are top notch quality as most Oakleys are.  The service and price from Amazon.com was great too.  I have weird eyes and these did not work for me.  My eyes have been funny ever since LASIK surgery.  I see great, but certian sunglasses hurt my left eye.  It is not the Oakley's fault.  It is just my eye.  I wish I could wear them.  Returning them was easy through Amazon.\", 5206: 'As I expected it is a great pair of glasses... I would suggest that if you plan to buy a pair of glasses get the polarize lens and of course Oakley is the best...I used this glasses for fishing and playing tennis and I love it.', 5207: 'I bought these several months ago for running, mountain biking, and life guarding.  I got the white pair with red lenses and they look awesome!  I get compliments all the time and they block the sun very well.  The first time you try and take out the lenses, they get stuck and you feel like you are going to break something but just keep working on it and they will come out.  After the first time, you can switch out the lenses in seconds.  The frames of the sunglasses feel very sturdy and have never slipped on my face at all.  They also have some kind of rubber on the inside near the ears that stick to your head and become even more \"sticky\" when they become wet from sweat or rain which prevents them from slipping off.  They come with a case, two pairs of lenses(one for sunny and the other is for cloudy weather), a container of waterproofing stuff you put on your sunglasses, a cloth case, a cleaning cloth, and the frame(of course).  If you can afford these and you want a very nice pair of sunglasses that will last, get them and you will be happy.update: after a year of pretty heavy use the lenses still do not have a scratch(except for where it drags when your swapping the lenses).  Even though the frame is some form of plastic it is very strong and show no damage.  I still get compliments all the time about how good they look and it was definitely worth the price.update(10/30/2013): It has been over 2 years since I bought these and they still look close to new.  A couple of scratches have formed but really there should be hundreds with the amount of times that I\\'ve smacked into something.  My eyes have been spoiled by these and I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever be able to go back to cheap lenses again.Just as a side note, these are not really for every day use(white with red lenses).  You kind of look like a robot if you are just wearing them for the sake of it.  They are perfect for lifeguard though because having a little more flashy lenses is more acceptable.  Its been years and I still get compliments all of the time.  Oakley is a great brand and they have less flashy sunglasses(also probably cheaper) if you are looking for an everyday pair of sunglasses!', 5208: 'Fits well for women or men. No too big and was able to get my prescription in them. Great for biking or just casual wear. I love them.', 5209: 'Hi, I love that sunglasses, but before buy them I need be sure that sunglasses are polarized, thanks.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00502C9GG/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?ie=UTF8&m;=ATVPDKIKX0DERBlack Ird Pol/Black Persimmon', 5210: \"nice glasses but I thought bothh lenses are supposed to be polarized. had lots of compliments Overall I'm happy with them.\", 5211: 'UPDATE 07/23/12 !!! - Fortunately for me I live VERY close to an Oakley Vault store and took my Fast Jackets to them to get some help repairing/ordering the part I needed to fix my issue. Before I even brought out my receipt showing them that I payed for them here on Amazon the manager offered to replace my frame with one they had in the store. 2 minutes later I had a brand new Fast Jacket frame and a HUGE smile on my face. Oakley customer service gets an A+++++! Therefore bringing my total satisfaction to the new 4 star rate! The employees in that store did tell me that this was the first occurrence in which the Fast jacket lock tab had broken since they got them in. I firmly believe that.UPDATE 07/06/12 !!! - I took my new sunglasses on vacation with me and finally got some good wear out of them. Last night on the way to dinner in lower sunlight I decided to switch to the G40 lenses (which I LOVE to drive with btw) and the plastic connector that holds the latch on the frames BROKE! I had swapped the lenses out two or three times since purchasing these glasses but nothing excessive. Im going to attempt to swap these out for some new ones but if its not possible I will have to contact Oakley to get the part OR I might even have to ship the entire frame to them for a replacement part. (THUMBS DOWN) Either way I\\'m fairly disappointed. Most of my other Oakley purchases have been good ones but these frames seem to be sub-par in their manufacturing. I\\'m lowering my stars to 2 because I love the lenses, styling and idea behind the lens lock, I just wish the implementation/manufacturing had been a little better.06/01/12 - These glasses look amazing. They are super comfortable. Functionality in the lock system is unparalleled. I would/will buy more/other colors.The lenses are amazing. I love the red polarized lenses as far as color. I do, however, prefer the standard lens shape to the XL or XLJ shape which touch my cheek bones but I am slowly but surely getting used to the XLJ shape.The lenses and rubber accessories are VERY easy to remove/replace without needing to go to the store to have them do it. I own 4 pairs of Half Jackets and they can be a nuisance to change. The corners eventually wear out and no longer stay put. This is not true, however, with these now that they changed the method of replacement. I purchased a set of red (and blue) rubber accessories to go with them and they look SWEET!The glasses, case, accessories, etc come in one box and packaged rather minimally. I was impressed. I WISH they had come with a white case and not a black one but the bag is the new updated style that contains a lens holder inside and is rather nice looking as well compared to the old standard black bag that Oakley used to give with their glasses.I was a little disappointed to NOT receive the pen to \"waterproof\" the lenses that they state is included in the description. Not a big deal to me though as they already come with so much.More to come...', 5212: 'These sunglasses look amazing and are comfortable. They have great optics through the lenses. I would definitely recommend these to anybody. Buy these glasses!', 5213: 'I saw these at a local retail store and had to have them immediately even though the price was higher than on Amazon.  What you can\\'t see on the pictures is the frame detail.  It\\'s almost artistic.  The black frame is infused with what looks like white flowing waves or marble.  That\\'s the only way I can describe the look.  With the Blue Iridium Polarized Lens, the frame just \"pops.\"  I get so many compliments.  Simply amazing and better looking frames than any of other Oakley\\'s in my collection.Of course fit and optical clarity are superb.  I\\'ve noticed that some of the Fast Jackets are off-alignment and don\\'t fit my face well while other are perfect.  For this reason, I\\'m glad I  purchased in the local retail store.  I\\'ve read other Fast Jacket reviews stating this same issue and some think it\\'s a defect in some units of manufacture.Strong recommendation to purchase, but I\\'d try them on your head first to avoid shipping back to Amazon if they don\\'t align well on your head.', 5214: 'Polarized and the case and second set of lenses and the water resistant product and cleaning cloth all were included.', 5215: 'I purchased these glasses for my husband and he loves them!  He likes the fact that came with two different color lenses and the process to change them is very easy and convenient.  Great Product!', 5216: \"This is my 3 pair of Oakley's.

Versatile sunglasses for wearing around or for sports.  Hard to find replacement lenses and wished they had vented lense option.\", 5222: \"Amazon doesn't list these as Asian Fit in the product name but they do in the product description. As an asian I know the difficulty in finding proper fitting sunglasses.  I have a round face with an almost nonexistent nosebridge so I had high hopes that these would fit. But the nosepads don't even touch my bridge and the bottom of the frame rest on my high cheekbone. Also, amazon list the bridge as 15mm but they are in fact 18mm.But these are beautiful glasses. They're very lightweight and quite stylish. I'm not gonna be like others that give a one star rating because they don't fit, if you buy the wrong size shoes do you expect them to fit properly? These are very good sunglasses but they just aren't the ones for me. I'm sad to say that I'm going to return these. And though I've been wanting to own a pair of Oakleys for some time I don't think these are as high in quality as my Maui Jims. I have a pair of Ray Bans too but my 10 yr old Maui Jim's are the best.BTW, only 2 of the 5 styles listed come with polarized lenses. The ones I bought (Polished Black Frame/Black Iridium Lens) are polarized.  And I think all of the Pit Bull Asian Fit model numbers begin with 9161-xx.\", 5223: 'Great pair of sunglasses - comfortable and stylish.

Finally, I was able to find them on Amazon. They were $25 cheaper than anywhere else. The only thing I wish was more clear was that the picture really didn't show that the frames were black with blue inlays. I don't mind it, but I was going for a matte black finish all over the glasses. Oh well. Good price for Oakley quality. I'll buy their products again.\", 5229: 'Good quality.

I am a happy customer once again with Oakley!!  I have noticed a little bit of fog up even with the vented lenses.  I hope it doesn't get too bad when it gets really hot and humid around here.

It almost smells like perm solution.  I'm hoping the smell fades.  Second, it doesn't contain an internal zippable pocket that can be used for small items, change, (I know, who uses cash anymore or coins?)

In my opinion, the Oakley is better suited to someone who carries a laptop on a daily basis.- The laptop compartment is easily accessible and has dual zippers.  I was able to fit a Dell 15\" laptop in without problem.- The tablet sleeve is an internal sleeve in the main zippered compartment.  It\\'s large enough to accommodate an iPad in a case. There\\'s not a lot of padding, so look at this as a retaining sleeve and not anything that provides protection for your tablet.- The main zippered compartment is quite large.  Besides the tablet sleeve, there are two mesh organizer pockets large enough to accommodate a laptop power block in either.  You also have a fleece lined pocket (internally near the top) to accommodate a music device.  Finally, the room... There\\'s significant room in there!  I imagine it could easily store a change of clothes (when used as an overnight bag.)- More internal mesh organizers! The front (hidden) pocket has two additional mesh organizers which are roughly the same size as the others.  Store a mouse, cables (30-pin, micro-usb, mini-usb, portable hard drive, etc.)  You\\'ll still have a good amount of  room (accommodating up to 8.5x11 dimensions) but beware the mesh pockets are on the inside wall and not the outside facing part of the pack.- There\\'s two mesh beverage holders with elastic tops.  They will easily accommodate 12oz and 20oz or larger.Neutral- The padding between the laptop and the carrier is acceptable for short distances (when both straps are used and loaded with a moderate sized laptop.)  I can\\'t speak highly of the amount of padding, but it works.- When loaded with a laptop, the Oakley is much more comfortable compared to the Dakine 101L backpack.  However, it\\'s not nearly as good as the Swiss backpack\\'s made for laptops.Cons- I didn\\'t care for the strap design.  The Oakley straps seemed to be wider than they should and resulted in the straps seating further out on my shoulders than I felt comfortable with.  The Oakley would benefit from contoured straps which would pull the straps inward to the carriers chest.- The sternum strap on this bag is a gimmick.  Yes, there is one, but it doesn\\'t provide a lot of value.  The design is such that it is dependent on a snap button, making it easy to remove, and reposition.  Unfortunately, when you try and use the strap to properly position/ accommodate for the poor strap design,  the tension causes the snap button to pop and come off...  If Oakley was to accommodate a sliding sternum strap (such as Dakine or others) this would be of value.  However, in the current state, the strap is essentially worthless.SummaryAt this price point, I find the Oakley to be a good choice for the professional whose bag is of minimal to moderate weight and is looking for a bag with a bit of style.  It provides good room and security for all the essentials.  You do, however, sacrifice come comfort in this bag (It\\'s not anything you\\'d want on when biking.)  If you plan to carry more gear, you may wish to source another bag with better straps and padding.ScoreI\\'d rank this bag at 3.5 - 4 stars.One star is docked for the strap design.  If Oakley addresses this in the future, the bag would definately be a 4 - 5 star rating.', 5266: 'Lots of pockets and flat storage for laptops and papers.  Oddly enough, the water bottle holder on the sides get used all the time for more than just water.', 5267: 'Bought it to replace school bag, more than I would normally spend but the quality of the material and how it is made I am hoping it will last until the end of the next school year.

Compares favorably to my beloved Ogio backpack I passed along to my son.', 5292: \"This is a great backpack, its lasted me a long time so far. A couple of hiccups though. When the pack arrived it had a few precise slits in the bottom, but it hasn't affected the bag's functionality at all. A note to you future buyers though: The picture show that there are two main zippered pockets; there are two of them, but there is actually only 1 full-sized cavity for books and such. the second one is only half-sized. That hasn't been a major problem for me though. I hope this help!\", 5293: \"Ok, I have one major problem with this backpack. I bought the black color of this pack and it looked totally different than in the picture. In the picture it shows like a black and light grey theme. With the linings where the zippers are at light grey and the rest of the pack, for the most part, black. But the actual product doesn't have the light grey lining where the zippers are, its all black.I originally bought this pack because I liked the look of this theme. However when it came and it was a different color, I was taken aback a little but I actually like the one they shipped me more than the one pictured. If i was in love with the pack that was pictured that I had originally bought that would be pretty annoying. Good thing I actually liked it more.There are two things that I really like about this backpack. The first one being that I usually throw my pack over 1 shoulder and I am sick and tired of having to adjust the pack because it is slipping off my shoulder. This pack is really well made. The straps are kind of grippy and hang on to my shoulder really well. No more adjusting! That in itself is awesome. The other thing I love about this pack is that it fills out nicely. What I mean by that is, whether you have just a little bit in the pack or a lot in the pack it holds very firmly. If you are carrying just a few things it wont get all soft and flimsy like other packs, it holds its shape which is nice.\", 5294: 'Muy bueno en los env&iacute;os y el producto es totalmente Original los felicito por tan buen servicio les doy 5 estrellas.', 5295: \"For a $40 duffle, you can't get much more stylish or functional than this. It serves as my every day gym bag and easily accommodates a weekend's worth of clothes and a notebook computer. You're not going to get a maze of organizational storage options here - there are two zippered end compartments and the main storage area - but you do get a decently durable bag sporting a tactical look.If you're looking for more storage options, a more outdoors-friendly bag or larger capacity, I'd recommend the Kitchen Sink bags by Oakley. They're considerably more expensive, but Oakley backpacks and duffles last for at least a decade of heavy use.\", 5296: 'I generally gravitate to Oakley.

As an aging teacher, I'm on my feet all day.  When I read the ad that these were &#34;insanely comfortable&#34; I had to give them a try.  Actually, they are a comfortable shoe and I recommend them.  I went on to buy other Ahnu shoes on the strength of the level of comfort they gave me.  However, I did have to return my standard size and get one size larger.  I would recommend this half size jump to save the hassle of a return.\", 5319: 'These fit snug.  They are very comfortable for walking but have low soles if that is an issue for you.  Great shoe if traveling and walking all day.  Very comfortable right out of the box.', 5320: 'This is my first pair of Ahnu shoes, and I am very impressed. They are amazingly comfortable and lightweight. The lower part of the show is covered with a rubber making it resistant to water; a nice feature for early-morning walk in dew-filled grass. They work with jeans or shorts. I was a fan of Clarks shoes, but I think Ahnu has surpassed my expectations and earned its status as my favorite shoe.', 5321: 'Very comfortable shoes.  This is my second pair.  I like the styling because they are a little unusual.  I ordered 1/2 size larger than normal.', 5322: 'I really like the Ahnu Belgrove.  They support my feet well and are light.  I gave them 4 stars for one reason-they show dirt. Most of the shoe is Suede, and that is a bit hard to clean. The upper leathers can be cleaned, but it is a pain! So, if you buy a pair of these shoes, get a darker color. One other thing, my shoe size is 11, and the Belgrove fit fine in a size 11.', 5323: \"I bought this shoe two weeks ago and am enjoying them a lot. The smokey brown color looks great and the shoes are very comfortable. They're a bit stiff at first but after a few days of walking they've worn in nicely. They look great with shorts and can be dressed up a bit with pants. I'm using them primarily for walking and a bit of light trails and they're great on both surfaces.One warning, these shoes run a bit small. I'm a consistent 11 and ended up buying the 11.5. Luckily, I was able to try these on at a store before buying but ended up buying them on Amazon as they were a bit cheaper.\", 5324: \"This is my second pair of Ahnu shoes, I didn't knew this brand six months ago when i bought my first pair, so confortables that I decided to go for the second pair, no regrets, excelent choice for use at the city or waking into the wild.\", 5325: \"I'm really pleased with these shoes.  They look great and are a good comfortable fit.  I don't know how they would feel after walking in them all day on concrete since I haven't had the opportunity but I image one might want to add a little more cushion since the soles are somewhat stiff.\", 5326: \"I learned of the Ahnu brand after seeing, trying on and purchasing a pair of Ahnu's FireTrail shoes about a year ago at a well known 'discount' store. They were great out of the box, though they had a few issues - they were also subjected to circuit training which included such torturous things as hill sprints and burpees. I barely survived, so I was impressed the shoes fared so well. I still have them, in fact I wore them this morning.This pair arrived today just after 11 am and I slipped my feet into them. Ahnu has upped their game. The insole was incredible, the fit was just right. I fit a 10.5 or 11 depending on the brand. I ordered an 11 and I feel I could have gone either way with these. They are super comfortable and felt like they were almost already broken in. I adjust my socks, descended down four flights of stairs and went for a walk during my lunch. 9 hours later they're still on my feet. Not only are they comfortable, they look great!I'll update as I continue to use them.\", 5327: 'I bought Charcoal Grey in Size 9.5.

Lenses swap out in a breeze.  The ONLY down side is the wind gasket some times comes free from the frame, just need to take it off and re seat it.  Doesn't include polarized lenses, but they are available.  Also, don't use the polarized lenses if you have digital instruments  on your motorcycle...the polarization plays funny tricks with the screen.\", 5333: 'A year later and they still look brand new. They have held up to a year of kayak fishing and camping with no problems. A little stiff and more pockets are my only complaints. But they are swim trunks not &#34;shorts,&#34; I guess. They have one pocket and it usually suffices.', 5334: 'When I bought this frame, I was not sure it will work as a eye glass. But it did. I took the frame to my optometrist where my eye prescription were fitted with the glasses in the frame. After a few week of getting used to, now it fits and feel natural.

I bought these instead and they fit about the same and the gray color matches some of the Under Armour shirts he has.', 5343: 'These shorts are of very good quality. They are thick enough to be durable but not hot. They do not have elastic around the waist which I think in more comfortable a allows for a better fit. I ordered three pairs and will order at least one more.', 5344: 'Good fit.  Good material.  Looks sharp.  These Oakley board shorts should last a while.  Will use them from beach to gym.', 5345: \"These are perfect for wakeboarding.  These are a very traditional board short design, and do not include any inner liner.  The rubberized drawstring is a plus that keeps them tied around your waist (and not wrapped around your ankles after an embarrassing fall).  I also occasionally wear these to the gym and they work okay for weight lifting shorts, as well.  I usually wear Under Armour compression shorts under them, but it probably isn't a necessity.  I typically wear a size 34 waist in jeans/pants, and the size 34 fits me perfectly.  A friend of mine says he has to get a size larger than he typically needs, because these are too tight in the upper leg for him.  So if you have bigger legs or a disproportionate amount of junk in the trunk, you may need to go a size big.  These are a bit tight to pull on and off, but again that helps ensure they keep their proper place while out on the water.  The material has a soft, almost suede-like feel, which I also like.  Two issues keep me from rating these shorts five stars.  One downside to this design is that these shorts do not have enough pocket space for keys/wallet/phone when you are not in the water.  The other flaw is the tiny velcro fly.  The fly is attached on both sides with a contiguous strip of material, so there is no convenient access for bathroom breaks.  All in all, for the price I paid on Amazon I would recommend these Oakley Boardshorts.\", 5346: \"Was looking for a plain colored boardshort, and this fit the bill great - fits just like any other board short, is soft and comfortable to wear.  Seams are well done, and it doesn't hold a lot of water, making drying off a breeze.

Great shorts!\", 5347: \"I liked the first ones I bought, and they are still as good as new, but I wanted to go for another color. I thought these are the same, but these are lighter, with a different fabric. Although the first ones I bought are slightly heavier, but they sure dry quick! that's why I rated these with 4 stars, and the first ones I bought I would rate with 5 stars (excellent fit and look, and like I mentioned they sure dry very quickly!). Otherwise I do like these as well. I like the length of the Oakley's, I couldn't find another brand that makes them this long. And the quality is great.\", 5348: 'They have the same great quality as every other oakley product out there but the size runs a little tight.', 5349: 'Great fit and timeless look; rubber grips on the strings to prevent slipping.

I prefer my compression shorts to have a anatomically snug fit.\", 5352: \"I love the way these fit and look. They're form fitting but don't reveal exact shape and details, if you know what I'm saying. The low waist keeps my little bit of a paunch from mushrooming out. I'm doing a lot of hot yoga and my paunch is shrinking. Perhaps one day I'll be able to wear these to hot yoga without a shirt and just look sexy. Perhaps not.\", 5353: 'A Little low cut for my taste, but excellent grip for swimming. Would love to see it in other colors', 5354: 'I really like these shorts.

The shorts feature a real zipper with Velcro on top and a nonslip lace tie, which is much nicer than the total Velcro fly found on many pairs of board shorts. This is my first pair of Oakely brand shorts and I will definitely seek them out in the future.', 5366: \"The title says it all.  They are so comfortable, they always have a pocket where you can fit something small that you can afford to get wet (perhaps your driver's license that you need to show at the bar when you're relaxing by the pool on vacation).  They dry really fast and always look stylish.\", 5367: 'These are by far the most comfortable shorts I have ever worn, there is no tightness in any areas as the fabric stretches to fit you as you mov ein the water.

Magic.The past few seasons I have bought Under Armour Heat Gear.  The price is the same as the Oakley offering.  The most noticeable differences are all attributes of the Oakley over the UA:- the collar is taller and softer- the sleeves are longer- the fabric is lighter weightI am 6'1&#34; and weigh about 155.  I bought the medium.  It is very snug fitting which is ideal for me.\", 5375: 'I am not sure they have UV protection, they are thinner and softer that other which I love but if You want protection read and ask', 5376: 'Get the white,  it looks better then the grey, used it to swim and protect in Mexico, looks and feelsgreat and does not lose its shape, i have 3 of them', 5377: 'Love this shirt, saves my skin when I go into the ocean.  I use it all the time, also great sun protection.', 5378: \"This is my first rashguard and I chose this one after my research. I wore it on my vacation in Ixtapa every day on the beach and in the water for 2 weeks. It fits great ... yes a large is a perfect fit ... I am 6' 1&#34; and about 188 lbs. A medium would have been too tight. It is stretchy and fits great ... white goes with everything ... excellent in the water ... and the fabric kept me cool out of the water and under a palapa (umbrella). Also, no sunburn ... love it.\", 5379: 'I bought this to wear while swimming in an outdoor pool at midday.  I wanted it to block the sun without restricting my swimming motion.  It performs effectively in both respects.  I am 6 foot, 185 and sometimes buy medium size shirts, but bought this \"large\" based on customer reviews of several similar products.  Even so, this fits very snugly and is hard to get on and off when wet.  That is as it should be, because the result is a very comfortable swim.  Water does\\'t get inside the shirt and cause it to \"balloon,\" as is the case when I simply wear a polyester T-shirt.  Just as importantly, the shoulder seams are made to allow free movement without any \"grabbing\" of the fabric.  My strokes are smooth with no discomfort from the shirt.  I am very satisfied with this product.', 5380: 'Bought this for my husband. He normally wears medium but I got a large based on one of the reviews I read. Glad I did as it fits well and he is happy.', 5381: 'very good product. Did not have a problem whatsoever. Product is as described.

Lets see how it performs', 5383: \"I like the design and it fits well.  I also like the material, which is light, and it doesn't feel hot under the sun.\", 5384: 'This shirt is very nice and works as expected.

Not too long. Great pair of shorts.', 5386: \"Absolutely love these shorts! The material is fantastic and really cool.

I may buy again', 5390: \"I love this fleece! It fits true to size, i suggest you air dry this just to make sure it wont shrink. But if you want to be different from everyone else wearing a North Face, Oakley is the way to go. Surprising enough this does keep the wind and rain out, even though it's so thin.

Looks lovely with black jacket, and do like it with the oakly jacket', 5398: 'i really like this sweater.  its very practical and has a great fit.  my only complaint about it is that when you sit and you have it zipped up the pockets sorta pop out making look like you have a belly.  the headphone jack (in the pocket so you can run the headphones from your mp3 player through it) is awesome.  the color is a great choice.', 5399: \"This sweater is a stylish and comfortable. I'm 6'1 tall and purchased an xxl, and it fit me a little big but despite that it looks great. If your at least 6 feet a better fit is xl.\", 5400: 'Gave this to my son for christmas and he loves it! Fits well and keeps him comfortable all while looking Cool.', 5401: \"This boardshort actually has an inner compression short (like biker shorts) to prevent chafe and rash and the regular outer board short.Does it work? Sort of.Surfing can really get you a bad rash on your legs (where the shorts rub) and on your crotch (which rubs everytime you stand up).These shorts decrease the rash about 80% but you will still get some rash after a few hours in the water.The compression shorts are black and can been seen if you sit down or your waist band sags a bit.Another downside of the shorts is that it traps sand/dirt inside if you take a tumble in the whitewater. Normal shorts are loose enough that sand will wash out but the compression shorts will hold any sand inside. At the end of your surf session or bodysurfing, I've had the shorts full of sand.\", 5402: \"I gave this four stars because it fit's great , very comfortable and light weight , keeps you cool etc . However i find its a bit to expensive.\", 5403: 'I bought this sweatshirt for my boyfriend but accidently ordered a Large instead of an XL.

I do not think if I even ordered an XL that it would fit my boyfriend.', 5404: \"Purchased this through amazon at more than 60% off msrp.  At this price, for gortex, it's an awesome piece.  Full range of motion where it counts and totally waterproof.  It fits a bit narrower at the waste, which I like, but you may have to upsize to avoid limiting range of motion.  I've used it three times, once in deep powder, and have no complaints.\", 5405: \"You see a lot of people wearing their North Face Apex Bionic soft shell jackets around, and this is a great way to be different from that.  For me, it's good down to about 30-35 degrees.  Repels water as advertised and the hood is a great option.  One minor detail that I love is the double zipper.  Great for when you are driving and zip the bottom one up a little to give yourself some working room while sitting.  Received many compliments on this jacket.\", 5406: \"cool stuff, I just love it, it was a great experience to ear that jacket...

The originals were starting to tear/rip/dissintegrate after about 6 years of solid use (pretty darn good).What I wound up doing was spraying Pam, yes, Pam on the arms of my glasses before wiggling these babies on.  Once on, they have a great fit and look like the originals that came with the glasses.  Don't be worried if it appears the earsocks are starting to stretch a little as you put them on.

So far these are the most comfortable flip flop i have owned. The fit is quite snug so your foot feels very secure int hem and don't have to worry about losing one if you had to jog across a crosswalk or anything like that. The other part that got me were that these are very comfortable, they almost feel squishy and manage that without being obtrusively thick.  I will actually end up ordering the black pair more than likely as a back up. Spend the extra $5 compared to a standard thing flip fop and pick a pair of these up.

I run missions on MSC boats and am constantly walking around on non-skid, a very abrasive coating used on vessels to avoid slipping when the deck is wet. This stuff tears through boots in a hurry and when you fall it will tear your skin off in big chunks. But these boots have held up well despite being on these precarious conditions. I actually got these boots 3rd hand. Basically got them from someone who got them from someone who gave them to me. The boots have held up for over a year and are just now starting to fall apart at the seams around the front of the boot. Also the tread has about had it with being ate up by nonskid.

They fit well and never had issues with footing on the golf course. They did wear down over time because the spikes are molds but that is to be expected. These shoes were light weight and I constantly would walk 18 in them in the morning and then another 18 in the afternoon in summer time.The all black shoe was help full because they were very easy to clean after a round of golf. I used them mostly in Maryland during the summer time where it would rain and be wet they never leaked and were pretty close to water proof. my favorite part of the shoe was the comfort around the tongue of the shoe. It is oblivious when they made this shoe that they wanted a nice snug fit like a glove that was both comfortable and stable and Oakley hit that mark on the head.The only reason why I am giving this four stars is because these shoes just don't look particularly sexy on the foot. At this price it is obviously the value outweighs the sex appeal and you cant ask for everything but hey lets be honest functionality over fashion is important when your walking 18 regularly.\", 5486: 'Very light weight and comfortable boots for military use or civilian use.

When I first got these boots, I was surprised, since I was not aware they were 6&#34; boots, and not 8&#34;. I figured that Oakley would make them so anyone can wear them, but since they are only 6&#34;, I typically cannot wear them in garrison.  When I first put them on, I had the same issue with width as other reviewers have had. They run quite narrow and when you get them, they are pretty stiff, which can make them uncomfortable.  They do fit right up against the upper part of your ankle/lower shin, which at least gives your great support around the ankle.  The laces though are quite uncomfortable and could definitely be upgraded, probably benefitting from a material like Nike's SFB uses (paracord).Once they are broken in however, they were quite comfortable. The boot seemed to almost mold to the shape of your foot and provided great support in all areas, mostly due to the narrow fit.  I've not how them over a two years, and wear them mostly in the field, and they have held up quite well, despite their lightweight feel and original drawbacks. But again, make sure you are aware they are not AR 670-1 compliant, and will probably only be used if your unit has less strict standards or you're in the field/deployed.

This LSA Terrain boot by Oakley is extremely comfortable, breathes very well, and is very light weight. The soles are very tacky and as you walk in them you feel that you have a solid grip with whatever you are treading on. I suspect that the soles, being somewhat on the soft side might wear faster than other types of materials.I have a pretty wide foot, and usually wear 10.5 -11.0 US (wide depending on manufacturer). I had to purchase these in a size 11, and they fit great. A little snug in the width for me at widest part of your foot, but overall very comfortable with a slim athletic fit. Don't expect these to be bomb proof tanks weighing 3 lbs each- they are meant to be a fast, nimble light weight athletic boot.  I think that I could easily march many many miles in these babys without my feet crying. Being light weight material they also dry quickly. I would highly recommend these boots, just be careful picking your boot size.\", 5495: \"Took these bad boys out to the field and I'm surprised they handled the experience as well as they did. Talk about some great quality.\", 5496: \"I live in Florida and frequently hike through very wet/swampy areas and have a difficult time finding a boots that can drain water and dry out fast enough to keep my feet comfortable. Water proof boots don't work in many of these areas because the water goes over the top of the boots and then they take forever to dry out and leave you with swamped feet. For a while I have been using Vietnam style jungle boots, but I sure am glad I found these as they are much more comfortable. The LSA Water boot drains water incredibly fast and also dry out extremely fast. In addition, they are very comfortable. The second day I had them I took them out into the sticks and wore them for about 8 hours and had no blisters or hot spots on my feet, and this was without any sort of break in period. They are great for warm weather climates because they breathe exceptionally well, keeping your feet quite cool. They are also very flexible and feel like you are wearing a comfortable sneaker more than a boot.Overall, these boots are absolutely wonderful if you live in a wet and warm climate. I highly recommend them.\", 5497: 'I first saw this boot being used by some combat divers on R&R.; Anyway I decided to purchase a pair for myself and love it.The fit was true to size and very comfortable. It is cliche to say but it fits like a glove.I cannot overstate how easy it is to walk on a wet dive boat with these. I had the opportunity to go rappelling on a 1,000 ft waterfall in Belize and they were perfect.The only thing that surprised me was that they were positively buoyant but not more than a standard 3mm bootie.Great product that I highly recommend . BTW if you use it for its intended purpose as a scuba diving boot people will always ask &#34;are you really going to dive with your boots on ? &#34; lol great conversation piece', 5498: 'Nice fitting lightweight boot right out of the box. I was impressed with how light these boots are, after 10 hours on your feet that means alot. Like em alot.', 5499: \"I bought these boots from the Oakely retailer in Bagram Afghanistan and so far they are a great pair off boots. I did have the chance to try them on before I bought them and I'm glad because they were seem to run a little small I normally wear a size 12 and I got these in 12.5. I have only worn them around Bagram because they are very light weight and I'm sure if I took them on patrol outside the wire they would get torn up fairly quickly so I wear them around post to give my feet a break from my more rugged boots. Because they are designed to release moisture my feet never get overly hot or sweaty. I am looking forward to getting back home and taking them kayaking the soles are fairly sturdy and with the drain plugs I'm positive they will work fantastically as a pair of water shoes\", 5500: \"Well' I did want to use them in territory were there's gonna be dirt dust, don't recommend to use them there is going to get your feet socks dusty since there's vent holes on bottom sole, Bit hey they are called &#34;water boots&#34; also they foot someway small recommend half size bigger, they not wide enough, going to use when rainy days.\", 5501: 'Light and good. quite durable and comfortable when wearing. water does go in but it dry up very fast and it is very nice', 5502: 'so far okonly had them a few days.

There was a discount and I got it for $65. It has holes on the bottom to extract water which means the water will come inside the boots by the same holes but it has a good quality and I love it. BTW I had no problem with it when i hiked in the Blue Mountains, Australia. Very comfortable, light weight and tough and it sticks to the ground even though it was quite wet in some areas.', 5504: \"I've had these boots for about two months now, and I love them. They are the lightest hiking boots I've ever owned. They feel tight for the first 10 minutes or so, then you forget that you are even wearing shoes. They are great on dry land, and just as good going through wet terrain. They drain faster than any shoe I've ever worn. The only thing I didn't like were the shoelaces. They are pretty cheap for a $100 boot, but not a big deal. I bought a set of $2.00 laces and that was that.\", 5505: \"I didn't notice the white patent leather when I was looking at the shoe on line.  this is an amazing looking shoe and very comfortable.

I played my first round of golf in them yesterday and they were incredibly comfortable throughout the entire round.  I wear a size 13 in mens and these are true to the size, one of my fears when ordering shoes online.  The white leather does become dirty, very fast, however they clean up very easily with a white shoe cleaner or leather cleaner.  I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone.\", 5510: \"I was skeptical ordering these based on a previous review that stated that these don't come in wide widths. Considering wide was an actual selection provided and the fact that Amazon has free returns I took a shot. I'm happy to report that mine came in the wide width I ordered and they are a perfect fit. I'll try to come back and update my review once I've played a few rounds but based on my first impression these deserve the 5 stars I gave them.

For $15 I thought I would be getting a flip flop that would break in a summer. The toe loops will not break even if you yank on it with your hands. They also offer a some arch support, another rarity in flip flops. The slope a little downwards but it is refreshing on your feet. Lastly they are not the sweat absorbing type so stinky flip flops not an issue. I will buy again, not when they break, but when I loose them.', 5522: \"I have a wide foot and finding the right shoe can be difficult. But these 'fit' the bill.

But then I found them at the Oakley store for $40! I have been buying them since. Sometimes I but two pair at a time and keep one pair for working and the other for going out.The soles are thick and cushy and feel as comfortable as a $100+ running shoe. The straps are lined with cushy neoprene and the toe webbing is thick, pliable, and soft. I can hike hills in the woods, run, and stomp through creeks without skipping a beat. Honestly, I wear these everywhere. I even have two similar styles with leather for going out to eat.I wear a 10.5 in shoes, but order an 11 in these sandals.

A couple brands like Reef seem to dominate the somewhat higher end leather flip flop game, but Oakley also tends to engineer products well and do some innovative things.  I own many of their sunglasses and some people say they're overpriced, but they don't break on me and the lenses don't get scratched up so they must be doing something right.  I'm the type of person that I like to buy something high quality and have it last, if I may more for a product so it achieves that, so be it.  I also have owned an Oakley kitchen sink backpack for a few years and it's got lots of innovative features and is built to last, so I gave these a shot.Happy I did.  The leather is high quality, and it's got a decent amount of padding without feeling bulky.  The overall look of the flip flops is great, not like I'd wear these to a dress event, but they are certainly multi functional.  I can wear them for a quick run to the store without feeling like a bum or I can wear them at the pool side.  I've had these about 6 months and they don't even look worn in yet, where as the cheap flip flops I buy start looking terrible by now and most break soon after (the middle thong part usually pulls out of the sole).  I'd bet these will last me at least a few years of good use, probably more.6/29/14 UPDATE-I've now owned these for a year and a half or so and they have held up very well.\", 5595: \"These are even better looking in person than they are online.

Oakley was one of the only brands that had my size. They fit perfectly and are very light and comfortable. Since they are waterproof, I wondered whether my feet would feel hot and sweaty.

The only problem I had was that I ordered a size 11 and received a size 11.5.  The box said size 11 and a sticker on the bottom says size 11, but the inside of the shoes says size 11.5.  I bought a set of shoe inserts and they fit fine.  This is not a problem with the shoe manufacture, there must have been a mix up when the ordered was fulfilled by Amazon.  I have worn them on the course and they worked great.  The shoes are as comfortable as a pair of gym shoes and look great.  I have yet to test how waterproof they are and how they grip in wet conditions.

Wear them from the house to the course.\", 5669: \"I had a pair of Oakley golf shoes about 12 years ago that I loved, but my last few pairs had been Footjoy's, with Oakley's being a little difficult to find.  Purchased these to be my second pair, I have a pair of all black Footjoy's that cost almost twice what these did which are only a year old.  Almost immediately I realized these would be my number one pair and the Footjoy's would only get brought out when the course is really muddy.  Extremely comfortable right out of the box.  I was concerned if there would be enough traction, I tend to generate a lot of torque when I swing, but these bad boys delivered as well as any traditional pair of spikes I have worn.  I am typically wear a size 10 but sometimes require a 10.5.  I purchased the 10 and they are fine, but they are a little snug compared to my Footjoy's.  I am sure they will stretch out a bit, and for now a pair of thin socks takes care of the issue.  Great shoe, especially considering the price, not sure they can be beat.\", 5670: \"I've owned a lot of different brands and styles of golf shoes and these are, by far, the most comfortable. I need a wide golf shoe and they are hard to find locally. Amazon is where I buy my work boots, my jogging shoes and my golf shoes because of the better size selection. These golf shoes are light weight and extremely comfortable. I can't speak to their waterproofing yet.

These fit the bill.NOTE: They're a little tight, so you may want to get a larger width.  However, don't let this deter you.\", 5676: \"Very comfortable shoe, no break in necessary.  Grip is adequate, even in the wet.  Not a huge fan of the looks and the midsole is slowly turning brownish - I'm not sure the shoes will ever look even remotely clean again.  Waterproofing is good for about 12 holes in the extreme wet, which is about average in my experience.  I mostly walk and the spikes are showing moderate wear after about 20 rounds.  We'll see what they're like a year from now.In 25 years of golf I've never before had a pair of truly comfortable golf shoes.

Time will tell.', 5679: \"These are spike-less golf shoes and I must say they are excellent. These can be worn in any conditions including mud and rain and they perform great, not to mention these look great and feel good. Be warned they fit a little loose and you need to tighten the laces tight so the shoe doesn't move too much around your ankle. Because of the motions of a golf swing it is inevitable for a foot to move in this shoe.\", 5680: 'While vacationing I severely damaged my Oakley Fuel cell sunglasses. As I was out of town at the time I picked up a replacement set at a local boutique. Upon arriving home I found replacement lenses on Amazon. My original glasses were the dark grey lens style, and since I replaced the glasses with the exact same style I decided to order these lenses to replace the damaged lenses so I could enjoy 2 styles. When I received these I installed them into my old frames, which was very easy, taking only seconds. Wow! I think I actually like the bronze variety better than the grey, these really sharpen your environment, while still blocking the sun. I find I wear this pair more often than my original grey set.', 5681: 'i got this as a replacement for my normal fuel cell lens since it was badly scratched.

This is why I keep shopping with them.\", 5683: 'I purchased my Fuel Cell sunglasses almost 2 years ago with \"normal\" lenses.  After being careful for a year, they began to accumulate scratches until they were nearly unusable.  On a recent beach trip to Clearwater, Florida, I experienced polarized lenses on different brand sunglasses that I had borrowed.  I had been trying to decide between what replacement lenses to get, and after using some bronze polarized lens glasses I was sold!  They were easy to install (I took a few minutes to clean the frames well with the lenses out) and are fantastic!  It\\'s like looking at life in HD!  Everything is brighter yet I don\\'t squint at all.', 5684: '(+) As a lifeguard these came in handy for \"looking into the water\" (i.e. the polarized lenses cut out light shining back at my eyes so I can perceive whats going on in the water better). Everything is remarkably clear and \"pops\" especially at noon when the light from the beach or concrete really strikes back at you!(-) These are not as \"bronze\" as I would have liked. These are slightly more yellow than brown. These do not have a mirror-like coating like the original lenses my Fuel Cells came with. One of the advantages of those was that no one knew where you were looking. Caught a lot of sneaky kids that way.', 5685: 'If you want to take good care of your eyes this is it!!Excellent quality.

I'm difficult to fit, generally speaking, so I usually order a size large to error on the side of caution being a larger sized person.  The cup size fits but there is ZERO support, even with the halter straps because the fabric is so soft.  I assumed there would be some type of underwire or something that would give at least a little bit of support.. but that's my own fault for assuming.  I figured I would mostly wear it as a halter and maybe be able to go strapless if I could tighten the back enough.  That was no wear near an option because I have a narrow ribcage for my cup size.  Mediums don't usually fit me but in this case, I almost wonder if it would.. but then the cup size probably won't.Overall:Good product, high quality material, pretty aqua color.Zero support, even with the halter straps on.There is not an issue with the product, it just doesn't work for MY body.I didn't return it because it's super cute and I can wear it for laying out.\", 5694: \"I was looking for a top that won't show too much of my boobs as i got stretch arms after pregnancy, so this suits me perfectly, the only thing why it doesn't get max. points is that to get that perfect fixation you have to tie it back pretty hard thought i have only B size, i guess it will be not that comfy for people with C and bigger bust\", 5695: 'Fits perfectly, looks sexy, I like the shape and color and it gets dry fast, so I do not need to have changing clothes with me ;)', 5696: 'Nice fit, good fabric and quick drying.

Oakley makes durable and fashionable products - this backpack is no exception. The pockets on the sides are not the flimsy mesh drink holders you find on many backpacks - these have zippers to keep in all of your valuables. There is a place up front for you to store a baseball cap (a plus for my teenage son!), and it does a great job of protecting it even when books are in the backpack. There is enough space for all of my son's books, baseball cap, and even a laptop. Because of the high quality materials used, the entire backpack seems sturdy and well put together.

This bag is high quality and sheet metal one just looks awesome, very cool. I also love the design. I'm not gonna be the ones who has a plain black duffel bag that looks like everybody else's anymore. This bag is pretty big and can fit alot of clothes and other stuff when I go camping and fishing up north. It's also great for all my airsoft gear when I go for weekend skirmish. Fits my chest rig, helmet, extra clothes, etc. The only thing that is a con would be the price tag. I thought it was a little expensive but couldn't say no to this bag as I was in need of one and this one just grabbed my attention.

The only negative is that, after awhile, some of the material near the front zippers started to fray a little bit, which is not a big deal at all.Now, I bring it with on vacations and road trips, and it fits everything perfectly!

Like Goldilocks said, it\\'s just right.Love the cool metal look although the 3 buckles on the front, which I had designs for a carabiner or two for, are surprisingly slim and won\\'t even let one carabiner around them.  Disappointing in that respect that they are only aesthetic and not even the slightest bit functional.Also, the pack really needs a chest strap.  No idea why, for all this money, Oakley doesn\\'t include one.  Went out and got a third party strap but, of course, it\\'s not the same as an integrated one.Although Oakley made a few questionable design decisions that could really use improvement with the Kitchen Sink 2.0, still very happy with my purchase and would recommend this backpack highly.

I'm very tough on my backpacks and this one looks feels STRONG!!!Plenty of room too!\", 5738: 'This bag is absolutely wonderful!! well made, durable, just what we needed. My son plans to use this one bag for his high school years, we will see.', 5739: \"I got this bag for my son for Christmas. He really likes it. He uses it every when he goes to work. He is very particular on what he likes. It's just the right size and has lots of places to put things.\", 5740: 'Very good construction, excellent zippers and rugged.  The top flap is a little cumbersome to open but it is a good size for work..  I do no tool at this as a day back for hiking.

Overall i love the feeling of carrying a quality backpack.', 5742: 'The Bathroom Sink bag by Oakley is a great bag.

Had to return it.', 5744: 'My husband purchased this as a travel backpack to replace one he gave to our son.  It is really not large enough for that purpose so it has become the family overnight pack.  We like it and use it, just not for the original purpose.  Now we have the kitchen sink too.', 5745: 'It is very suitable to my need for schooling. Cool looking. But, i thought it a canvas or khaki materials, little different.', 5746: 'We love the size and the different pockets, the larger size is way too big. This is ideal for a regular backpack to work', 5747: \"I was looking at the Kitchen Sink in Ohare the last time i travelled through.  I am really glad that i ordered the bathroom sink.  It is already bigger than i need.  My Dell XPS 1330 fits right in and is held snug.  If i had the larger backpack, i think it would have sloshed around in there due to the larger size.  This way it is held snug.  There is plenty of room for cords, charges, pens, etc.  I am a conservative packer, so i don't carry everything that i own, only what i need.  This pack holds it all and then some.  I have received nothing but compliments on the looks of the bag.  I tell people it is a parachute - they get kind of nervous, but it is fun to get some people riled up.  Great bag.  I highly recommend it.\", 5748: 'Love this pack!

However, that does not make it any less of a great and durable bag.', 5752: \"The Infinite Hero 1/2 Jackets are worth the money.  They come with a large hard case that houses the grey iridium lenses as well.  The purple bag is great for cleaning the lenses on the go.  Also, thrown in is a nice pin, additional nose guard replacements.  Granted, if you go to Oakley's USstandardissue site and you are either military, police, or government or have a military/law enforcment/CAC badge ID card you can get them for $110 when you register on the USstandardissue site.For everyone else, you do get what you pay for!!!\", 5753: 'I love the options that come with this pair of sunglasses. The purple mirror lenses and the gray lenses are great for bright to medium sunlight. I also got me clear lenses for night time riding on the Harley. Easy to care for.

Now I know and it's thanks to these awesome shades!\", 5777: \"I've been wearing the Oakley Antix (non-polarized) for the last 2 years and they were great even though they didn't quite fit my head properly. They were wide enough for my head but didn't seem to stay on the bridge of my nose very well so I was having to constantly push them back up since there always seemed to be a large gap between my forehead and the top of the frames that would not block out the sunlight. I went to an Oakley store at the local mall and tried on several different frames and loved the fit and feel of the Eyepatch 2 style, however, I didn't want to drop $215 +tax on a custom pair with polarized frames.  I looked on Amazon to see if they sold this particular style and much to my surprise they were there for $75 dollars less than the one's at the store!  I ordered them right away and they are by far the best sunglasses I've ever owned!  Comfort, style, and quality can't be beat!  They wrap around my big head easily and sit high on my nose so that I don't ever need to push them up.  These include the Oakley HD polarized lenses, not cheap imitations.  Love these!  I would definitely recommend them to my fellow fatheads.\", 5778: 'I didnt order mine from amazon but from oakley..with that said these are my FAV oaks by far that I own.I have a med face/head and usually wear my straight jackets but saw these and had to try em even tho they were for \"large heads\"..and let me say they fit PERFECT!! GREAT LOOK,GREAT FIT AND GREAT PROTECTION!!!..if youre lookin for new shades that are great all around dont think twice!!', 5779: \"This is my second pair of these exact glasses as my first pair were totalled in a motorcycle accident from some jerk face who decided to run a stop sign and test his theory of my secretly being super man. I won. The lenses are perfect. They give a great tint to life. They are more comfortable then the original Eyepatch glasses. These are great for all day wear and the day to night transition is pretty good too. I've ordered extra in case I'm not a fan of the next Eyepatch that comes out. For my big head, these are perfect. With the frames so big, they don't cut out your peripheral vision hardly at all, nor do they let all that pesky light in around the edges like others do. Fast delivery as well. Sooner than the expected time.\", 5780: \"Bought this as a present for my wife.  She had a pair before that went missing from her checked luggage.  This was a discontinued item by Oakley and so I was not very optimistic of finding one.  Lucky for me, it was availlable through amazon.  Wife received this item within four days.My wife loves these sunglasses.  She has a narrower face and it is the first wide coverage lens that fit her.  she usually wears sports sunglasses (mostly oakleys).  It's a tad heavier than her plastic framed ones but not so heavy.  She feels comfortable wearing it all day.\", 5781: \"This product is very good and  beautiful. I loved!! Perfect to gift for all women.

This was not my first pair.  They fit well, are polarized, though not good in glare.  I wear them jogging and they are comfortable, don't slip.

I always have at least two pairs of this model at all times. Lost my last pair on a catamaran of Waikiki. I pray they never disco these awesome glasses! The seller answered a question about shipping in a timely manner (I live in Hawaii, so it's always a bit of a pain to buy stuff online). They even bumped up the shipping one level to help out a bit. Overall, great buying experience for an awesome product.\", 5788: \"dont think they should get a 5 because they didnt come with polarized lenses but otherwise two thumbs up for looking swag'y and so far they havent been coming loose after a few weeks of having them\", 5789: 'Nice sunglasses, unisex, good protection for bikers without having to use the more traditional flak lenses. Good contrast in daylight', 5790: \"I have had my share of oakley's over the years and so with much hesitation I got these. I really hate how the lenses get scratched up so easily and the frames tend to wear out just the same. So I got these a few weeks ago expecting the same thing but still loving the brand. These proved to be a rugged build that don't slide all over your face. The lenses are still the same plastic but continue to better my vision when on the road, hunting, and boating. Would definitely recommend this frame but caution about the lens durability over time pending their use.\", 5791: 'I always buy a pair every summer! The Jupiter is the Ray Ban version but done better!  The looks and the performance!

I will buy another pair for sure!\", 5795: 'very nice style; very comfy; stylish and classylike the sleeves on the arms - non-slip will help glasses remain in placehowever, i do wonder how sturdy and how durable the hinge is...one tiny screw on each side...', 5796: 'Great styling, durable and fit well for any occasion!!!!Have bought new lenses to go with them!!!!!!Just get them!!!Great stuff from a great brand!!', 5797: \"More than i expected.. and the deliver due the weather conditions was right on time... thanx you guys very much. Can't wait to shop again.\", 5798: 'They are ver nice, durable, rigid and great quality lens. Good for sport as well as fashion item... Love them', 5799: \"I got the sun glasses 2 days after I ordered them and right out of the packaging I was impressed. They didnt squeeze my head nor did they feel like they were going to fall off the moment I tilted my head down. They fit just right. Also the lens on these are excellent quality. The ad says they are not polarized, but I'd say these are by far the best non polarized lenses I've ever had. I would suggest these to any one looking for a new pair of quality shades.\", 5800: 'I love oakley clothing... I loved it, I think it will last forever, the quality is just perfect... loved it', 5801: 'Great Glasses, Good to use for active lifestyle and looks great as well. Would Highly Recommend. 2nd pair after my husband misplaced the first ones', 5802: 'The ruber grip make that does not match as well as other Okleys (Holbrook) with my motorcycle helmet. But are very confortable.', 5803: \"I bought this for my husband as my Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it. So much that he wears it all the time. Only comment is it's very fragile and is easily scratched because of the glossy finish. We also saw reviews from other people saying that the lenses are easily scratched as well.Oakley sells replacement lenses so that's fine, I guess. :)\", 5804: 'The pictures misinterpret the actual product, the real sunglasses dont have the green on the corners. other then that they are beautiful sunglasses. very pleased.', 5805: 'I bought these for my boyfriend who loves Oakleys. These were a steal here. Totally authentic, arrived in mint packaging. Excellent quality shades.', 5806: \"I love sunglasses, and have a few dozen pairs of expensive brands.  I have a pretty average sized face and head, helmet size Medium, hat size 7 1/4.This is my second pair of Jupters, and probably not my last.  I really like this frame shape and design - it's not like the classic Ray Ban Wayfarer (or Oakley Frogskins), but more like those crazy surfing glasses that were all the rage 20 years ago.  Quality is Oakley through and through; the hinges ARE durable as hell, even for my clumsy hands, and the lenses are heavenly clear.  These are featherweight too, you'll hardly notice them on your face.  I have a narrow nose and notice that the nose pads (just like on the TwoFace) don't hit my nose, but instead the bridge of the frame hits the bridge of my nose - I never notice it because they're so light, but for small nose people like me it'll fit that way.  No complaints.  Stylish glasses, Oakley quality.\", 5807: 'Totally recommend. Great looking pair of shades for work and active lifestyle. Oakley has always put out a great product.', 5808: 'They are very comfortable. You can wear them for hours with not fatigue on the your nose or ears.They are a tad big for my face, but the comfort is key.', 5809: 'I\\'ve been searching around Oakley for years now, buying multiple pairs of sunglasses. None of them ever quite tickled my fancy in every aspect, until now. I had gotten the Eyepatches, Holbrooks, etc, and they never quite fit my face. These not only look fantastic, but have the right amount of curves and the right amount of acute angles in all the right places. The rubber socks on the arms are wonderful, as the previous two models mentioned began to hurt my ears after a while. The \"O\" is sort of a dim golden color and is the perfect amount of subtley/show.Very satisfied with these.', 5810: 'My husband fell in love with these sunglasses when he tried them on at a store at Angel Stadium. I surprised him with them and he absolutely loves them. The fit is perfect.', 5811: 'I have a narrow face and the Holbrooks are just gigantic on me (like those giant party glasses.)  The Two Face are also not much different size wise.  These are just right, I can get away with this look, and love em.  Great style.  Good quality.  Getting a 2nd pair', 5812: \"I bought these sunglasses for my husband for Christmas. The retro plastic Ray-Bans are all the rage these days, but Ray-Bans don't fit my husband's head very well. They're always too small. These Oakleys have the same style, but fit much better. The rubberized ear rests are very comfortable. He now has them in Brown Tortoise and Black.\", 5813: \"I'm went to sunglass hut and tried on every pair of Oakley's that they had, not only could I not find a pair that look anything like this pair. But I also got them at a very good price! And delivered to me in two days!\", 5814: 'This sunglasses are great i love the yellow/orange color of the lens, fit as expected they are solid and well made', 5815: 'Ordered and they came very quickly and was exactly what it said it was they were a gift and I was ok to give it.', 5816: 'like it very much,but the price is too high,if its abt 100$ ,it will be a best choice for me', 5817: \"As a regular Oakley customer, I have reverted to non-polarized lenses due to the peeling and cracking in the polarization.  I was apprehensive, but find that these shades keep up very well with the tropical sun (in Barbados) and do not have to be whipped off the minute I walk in a shadow.The fit is better suited to narrow faces, but don't feel really tight.  They are lightweight and allow enough breeze behind the lenses to not be hot.I love the tortoise shell finish!  Really well executed.\", 5818: \"A terrific pair of shades. Light and comfortable but still durable. Excellent optical quality on the lenses. They look great, and come in a bunch of different colors -- I went tortoise-shell. The lenses are hard to scratch  - I've definitely dropped them a bunch and they still look new - and are easy to clean. I had a pair of the polarized kind, which I lost, and now have these... honestly I'm not sure it's worth spending the extra $50 on the polarized. These will do the job.\", 5819: 'Great for the Jamaican beaches!', 5820: 'Love these sunglasses. Moved from Ray Ban Wayfarers to these. They are not that much more expensive, are much more stylish, and are polarized. I wear these pretty much anywhere from cutting the grass to going to weddings in full suit and tie. The matte black is really slick.', 5821: \"I've had Oakleys before, but its been a few years.  My only issue w/ them is that I often see the same frames on seemingly everyone - friends & strangers alike. Individuality is lost.That said, it seems at present everybody is sporting frames that look three sizes too big for their face; & look like alien/bug eyes w/ the bat mobile wrapped around their head; a la the Crankshaft, Oil Rig, Gascan, Bat Wolf, or Fuel Cell.  Just a TERRIBLE look, imo.Enter the Jupiter Squared.  These frames are EXACTLY what I was looking for!  A progressively edgy take on a more classic inspired frame that should have a bit more longevity, style-wise, than other frame designs.  They are a little sportier than the Holbrooks or Frogskins, but still maintain a smart aesthetic.  Better yet, I have yet to see anybody else w/ these frames!  Nor does it feel/look like Im wearing the bat mobile on head!The frames are suitably light weight & stay on my head during my runs.The woodgrain frames are unique & quite gorgeous.  The metal accent near the hinge is nice as well.These are my first pair of polarized lenses & WOW what a difference!  Ive always enjoyed my Ray Bans of eight years, but these Polarized lenses are amazing. The clarity is unequalled.  As to the polarized lenses susceptibility to scratches, I have yet to experience it - as I have only owned this pair for a few days . . . time will tell.Nonetheless, I am COMPLETELY satisfied w/ my purchase.\", 5822: 'get a lot of complements from both sexes, the woodgrain is unique as compared to the black or white. lightweight frame and good fit, shipping was great, wish it came with a hard case though.  otherwise great buy.', 5823: 'Excellent product, light and very comfortable, i had used a lot of different sunglasses brands, and any of it compares to the quality of the Oakley glass, Polarized HDO is great.', 5824: \"These glasses are pretty stylish. I liked them a lot because they look like the holbrook, but they have a different attachment design. I like how they are able to give a value to your face as it shows more of the definition of my face. I know people's faces are different, but I would recommend trying these on from a local sunglass hut store just to see if you like them.\", 5825: \"Looks good, feels good. Can't ask for anything more. The rubber on the ear piece sticks to my head when it's hot which is a good thing\", 5826: 'These are, by far, the most undistorted glasses I have ever worn. The OO Red Iridium lenses are great at creating the perfect color contrast and really make the \"world\" pop! (Although my wife makes fun of me for having \"pink\" lenses.)What else do you need to know?The frames do not contour or \"wrap\" to my face like my Fives Squared. Not an issue, just stating for any prospective buyers.The \"Unobtainium\" earsocks feel great but are a little thick for floatable eyewear retainers.They wont hide your eyes, so mind your own business with these on!Could be my face shape, but these do seem to fog up quite easily in the upper inner corners of the lens.Overall these are a great match for me.Would I buy again? Sure!**9/29/12 Update: Still happy with these but the lenses get dirty quick and are tough to clean with provided cleaning cloth/pouch. Taking 1 star away from this. I do not feel as if these are as high of quality as my last two pairs of Oakleys (Gascan SI & Fives Squared) I may have to go back to my Fives just because I know they can take the abuse (I don\\'t wear these to work like I did with the Fives Squared)**1/27/13 Update: Adding a star back. These are getting better with age.', 5827: 'I Like the way they look is very cool. Probably i will buy the one the are metal cover in black.', 5828: 'This is the first pair of nice glasses i have ever bought and i dont regret it at all. I will always buy Oakleys for now on.', 5829: \"My husband loves these glasses. They're polarized, and the red lenses allow him to see well in the twilight and dusk times. They rest on his cheek, and have breathing room on the sides so they don't fog up. Again, he loves them.\", 5830: \"The only issue is that they don't cover the corners of your eyes so the sun can still get you of its at the right angle. Aside from that they fit great, are light weight, and the polarization is top notch.\", 5831: 'Fast shipping.  I really like them.  they are light and durable.  I love the polarized lenses.  Great glasses for a good price.', 5832: 'These are nice glasses but the picture & description both claim that they have RED lenses, they are not, they are purple.', 5833: \"Great polarized shades, the clearest optics that I've owned!Only one small issue, The shape of the lens sometimes allows sunlight from behind me to be reflected in my field of view. Not a huge deal, but distracting on the motorcycle.\", 5834: \"Oakley Men's Jupiter Polarized Square SunglassesI am satisfied with the product I purchased.  I  would recommend them to others.\", 5835: \"Ordered these for my husband's Valentines present.  He loves them.  They look food and fit great!

I've been jumping from cheap pair to cheap pair for the past couple of years and it's great to finally have a decent brand name with some serious quality behind it.The sunglasses themselves fit perfectly. The polarization helps immensely in the sunny state of Florida where I live. The look of the sunglasses is beautiful too, I'm particular to the nice red &#34;O&#34; on the side the the purplish tint on the glass itself is also very eye-catching.I would hope people be aware of the different Oakley designs and choose one accordingly to fit their face/style before complaining of issues with the product itself. Yes they don't cover the eye's completely as other models and they have a squarish design to them that doesn't fit or look right on everyone. That's why you should find an Oakley store or Sunglass Hut and try a few pairs on before you decide to make a choice.\", 5838: 'Purchased for my son.  He loves them and wears them for driving. Very nice quality and price was better than what is available here locally.', 5839: \"This was the 4th pair of Oakleys I have purchased over the last few years, and I just love them.They fit great, are very durable and lightweight.  With a highly active lifestyle this is very important.The only reason they did not get 5 stars is the rubber on the frames.  Being someone who sweats a lot, the rubber can get kind of gross.  Plus my croakies don't fit over this and I don't want to lose them when I am surfing/paddling/boating\", 5840: \"These sunglasses fit great and the lenses definitely cut down on glare a lot. They're stylish and I've received quite a few compliments, even from strangers.The only improvement I would make, I prefer sunglasses with lenses that complete obscure your eyes.

I always feel as though these lenses will scratch way to easily.  I wish Oakley would put some kind of protective resin over the lenses.  For the price of the sun glasses they should.  One scratch and they can be junk.  Think about what you'll be doing while wearing them.  Don't raise them up and put them on your head.  That's the best way to scratch the lenses.\", 5845: 'A big supporters of Oakley, this a good deal with a nice looking polarized lenses and long lasting .

The frame is much larger than I realized, and sit down toward the cheeks, but this only hits a bit when I smile widely. Otherwise they are comfortable and good for a smaller nose, which I have. The large hard case is great, although no belt straps, plus comes with a soft bag. The case is white with an embossed pattern.', 5853: 'Sunglasses are great!!  They have a subtle cat eye shape and are polarized.  Fashion mixed with functionality!!

I was concerned since the description says Non-Polarized that these would not be polarized, but when I put them in my cart they showed they were Polarized.

Arrived much sooner than expected', 5859: 'Confession, I have not purchased Oakley sunglasses prior to these.  I thought they were overpriced and a little pretentious.  However, I really wanted to try out some white sunglasses, and these not only met that criteria, but are also made in the USA (just seemed like a good idea to support the US on this one).  Turns out they are fantastic sunglasses!  The fit is just perfect - they wrap around enough to protect from the sun, but not so much that I look like I am trying to be a major league baseball player.  The lens color is lightish, but so far they have provided excellent protection from even very bright sun.  The fit is good - turns out the straight temple pieces prevent them from irritating the skin behind your ears, but the little non-slip pads keep them firmly in place.  I am really glad I spent a little more for these.  Highly recommend.', 5860: \"As expected, an OEM replacement for my original Oakley lenses. I'll be more careful with this set!

Inspect the lens that are delivered,to make sure they are in good shape.The seller of these lens sent a manufactured,sealed order,through Amazon.So check for the professionalism,after all,you paid good money for them.Then get ready for the transition to polarized lens.They enhance your vision with better color intake and that is worth every penny.

I use them daily and a few months ago they got dropped and I had a scratch in the center of one of the lenses.  I kept wearing them but the scratch was just too annoying.  I looked at buying replacement lenses from Oakley and they were about 3/4 of the price that I paid for the sunglasses themselves.  I searched on Amazon and found these lenses.  They were only $35, genuine Oakley, and polarized.  I figured for that price, which is about the same as generic lenses, I'd go ahead and give them a shot.  They arrived and fit perfectly into my Oakley ten frame.  They appear to be genuine and visually are just as good as the original lenses.

My last pair were the Oakley Half Jacket, and while I liked the sunglasses, they would creak when opening/closing and felt a little flimsy.  That being said, they never broke and functioned fine.  These Blender's feel like a definite step up.  They are sturdy and still light weight and the fit my head well.  They apply just enough pressure to the sides of my head they the don't feel like they would ever slip off when bending over or something.I bought the chrome pair and the look really good.  The frames and lenses are both very shiny and look like expensive sunglasses, unlike the plastic frames.  The only downside to these sunglasses is they aren't offered with polarized lenses in anything but black, but I may buy a pair of replacement polarized lenses and keep these for backups.\", 5895: \"I ordered these for a share holder within the company that I work for and he absolutely LOVES them. The way they fit, how the glasses actually work to keep the sun from not only being so bright but the way the glasses curve around his eyes and give him complete cover.

The earpieces are plastic all the way up to the hinge piece. I'm not sure how these will hold up in the long haul, but if they have replacement temples I think they will be ok. They fit well, and you don't have to worry about the rubber 'unobtanium' moving around you or tear at the very edge like they do, one thing that's always irked about Oakleys.

I couldn't find this pair at sunglass hut to try them on so I took a risk and I like them a lot. Very similar to the oakley whiskers but the frame has more chrome and the stem is thicker. Very comfortable to wear.\", 5903: 'Very good sunglasses. Easy, convenient. There are no claims. I constantly carry sunglasses, at me them was a lot of different. But these simply super.', 5904: \"I love'm. They're amazing glasses. They're light weight, and look amazing. I get compliments on them all the time.

I would get the polarized lens' they reduce the glare and protect your eyes from UV rays..\", 5908: \"The Oakley Blenders fully deserve 5 stars for* optics (speaking of polarization, you need to have it)* design: very good looking (subjective of course); I agree with others saying they are well suited for below-average head* comfort: nice tight fit, nice anti-slip rubber in the nose and ears areas, covers your eyes well (have enough curvature, also nice for that sporty look)But I do have some troubles in the durability area.Same as another reviewer, one of the nose pieces fell off and was lost. I'm pretty sure this happened while I was wiping the inside of the lens with a cloth because the piece did fell on the carpet on another occasion but was found. Not so lucky the second time because I didn't notice it.Another durability issue is with the lens. They seem to scratch too easily. Note: I did drop them, and am intensively using the glasses, including for sports activities such as running, trail hiking and even tried glacier travel. But still, they should not scratch like they do.Perhaps a third minor glitch is that one of the arms started to bend more easily than the other. The bindings are of course metal but they have no mechanism to control the opening/closing (such as a spring). Might not be an issue, probably they can be tightened.\", 5909: 'I bought a pair of polarized Blenders in preparation for a trip to Hawaii.  I wanted a good quality (wrap-around) metal frame that was both durable and lighter weight.  These met my expectations and I\\'m happy with my purchase.  I don\\'t believe they are as light as a Ray Ban aviator, for example, but very light for a sportier type of sunglass.  I spend alot of time on the water and the polarized lens are incredible for that purpose.  I am a 5\\'4\" female, 132#, and these fit my face very well.  My husband liked the glasses also, but they were too small for his face.  He didn\\'t put them on for fear of bending or breaking them once he realized they would be too small.  These are mens glasses and I tried on a pair at our local Oakley outlet before purchasing, so I would be happy with the fit!  They are great for me but if you have a big head (literally), you should try a pair on before ordering.  Best Regards!', 5910: \"I love these glasses.  And yes, mine came polarized. the only negative reviews here are from someone who expected polarized glasses and received a pair that were not polarized.  Mine are DEFINITELY polarized, they look great, lenses are crystal clear, and I love the look.  This is my first pair of Oakleys and I'm now a huge fan.\", 5911: 'I was out of town when I bought my original pair of these... On a trip visiting a friend. And I lost them recently and had to find a replacement pair. They are a smaller frame and lens which helps me because I have a small face. The lenses are polarized which helps me when I am being active and they fit nice and tight to my face. They do exactly what you expect a very good pair of sunglasses to do. They are great for driving and boating and anything else you need them to do for you.', 5912: \"Love the polarized lenses and the lightweight frames. I've had metal Oakley glasses in the past. These have a similar look with a lighter frame.\", 5913: 'Bought these for my wife as a gift. She loves them!', 5914: \"I first tried these on at a Sun-glass Hut where they were going for about $200. As any faithful Amazon shopper would do, I price checked them with my Amazon app and found them here for a GREAT price. As Oakley's, you know they are well made and sturdy. These frames really flatter my round face. I toggled a long time between the black with tortoise accent, and the tortoise with black accent, and finally settled for the black with tortoise accent. I really like them and am glad I was able to find them here!\", 5915: \"Love these!! I thought they would give me the bug eyed look, but they don't.

Was leaning toward a wayfarer-type style, but I know that style from a certain other maker of sunglasses tends to be heavy, not to mention the heavy price. Harder to find than I thought.  This style may be discontinued because I couldn't find it on the Oakley web site, but apparently that led to the outstanding bargain price.  The lenses are fantastic, the frame is light-weight but not flimsy, the fit is great as always with Oakley, and the shipping was pronto from Amazon prime.\", 5919: \"lightweight, no strain on the ears, temples, bridge, etc. Oaks are my new favorite brand.

It is good for short use.', 5923: \"When I first got them I thought they might have been fakes as there was no 'Made in USA' on the arms and there was a P sticker on the lens which I know Oakley never used to do.

In reality they are all purple (which I like better). Very light and cool. The soft case is maybe not the best for protection but I guess it works if you use it for cleanning them.', 5931: 'but alas, they were knocked off my face at a music festival only to have some jerk grab them and through them into the crowd.  If I could find this pair again I might buy another.', 5932: \"I did not realize the sweatshirt was going to be standard t-shirt thickness.

But still a good summer product.', 5935: \"I bought these after about a month of research.  I looked at a lot of different brands and styles, but in the end, nothing compared to the quality and style of Oakley.It came in the original box and microfiber bag and I successfully registered the product with Oakley (so I know they're legit and it extends the warranty by a year).One thing that wasn't well explained in the description was that they are designed to easily snap apart without breaking if they get sat on or stepped on.  So far, this has worked well for me and I have had no problems with loose hinges or anything.The lenses were just as describe and seem to be up to the normal Oakley standards.All in all, it was a great deal to get them a little cheaper from Amazon than a store.  10/10 would get these again.\", 5936: \"Iove these glasses.

The reflective Violet Iridium looks amazing out in sunlight and they're practically mirrors. The frame is a hard plastic with a decent amount of flex making it strong so you don't have to worry about snapping. The hinges were worrisome at first, but they're not that bad.

They are super light and I can't wait to take them to the beach volleyball pit. The only bad thing about these glasses is that the logo is white, not black like in the picture. I'd prefer it in black, but that's not a big deal.As sunglasses go, I'm sure you could find more advanced eye wear for less than $100, but we all know why we're buying these...they're a fashion icon from the 80s...they're just too cool for school.\", 5949: 'the best thing about my new shades is that they are made completely of plastic, so i can wear them inside the pool or beach and dont worry about metal pieces getting corroded woojoo!', 5950: 'Always wanted a pair of Oakley sunglasses.

The Oakley Blender fits great, looks great amd is well made.  Although the Serengeti glasses were made of glass and the Oakley is a polycarbonate, the optics are excellent.

Only thing I did not realize is that the Oakley details are gold instead of silver. I guess I just didn't pay attention because all of the ones we had looked at in the store were silver in detail. Either way, he loves them. And they were WAY cheaper than in stores.\", 5991: \"I saw these in a store and immediatley liked the look, I thought they were pretty similar to Ray Ban's.

You can order with no fears.', 5996: 'I was a bit worried because they are under \"replacement lenses\".Ordered the polarized and got them just as they looked in the picture polarized.(even though the description says non-polarized).The only complain I have is the grey lenses don\\'t totally block your eyes, but I knew this going in. I would def. try these on at the store first, they run bigger than you\\'d think in the picture.', 5997: 'Good sunglasses, they fit very well and do not move much when doing activities compared to other glasses.

If you do a lot of range shooting, Military / SWAT work, they are great.  If you want something for wrap around eye protection, they are great.  These are made for people with a smaller face / narrow where the larger Monster Dog sunglasses were just to big.

Fits great on the shoulder and can hold many things.', 6012: 'I\\'m writing this after just a couple days of use. I\\'ll update my review in a couple months so that it is consistent with what I\\'ve actually been experiencing.I\\'m coming from an absolutely enormous Jansport Backpack that I purchased ages ago. I need something that will carry tons of stuff all the time. This fits the bill for the most part. It\\'s a 30 liter pack and it makes good use of the room that it has. The laptop slot is just big enough for my massive 17.3\" laptop, by that I mean I really wouldn\\'t put anything bigger in there. So if you have one of those 18\" gaming laptops, I would recommend looking elsewhere. This probably won\\'t work. A complaint I do have is there isn\\'t a great place to put my power brick but I suppose that\\'s a minor one.The main compartment is nice and roomy. The pen and misc pockets are also in this area which is not something I\\'ve seen before (normally it has a dedicated pocket) but it seems to function just fine.The water bottle holders are one of the huge pluses of this pack and are one of the reasons I picked it. They will hold a 1 L nalgene problem just perfectly which is exactly what I needed. I tested a SwissGear SA1923 backpack prior to this one and was a bit annoyed that I couldn\\'t fit my 1 L bottles if anything was in the side pockets.I also really like the armored sunglasses shell. It has a soft coating for the sunglasses and is roomy enough to carry around 2 pair (as long as you don\\'t wear bug eye sized glasses.The pack itself is very light. That may be a blessing and a curse. The blessing of course being that you\\'re carrying around less weight. The curse may or may not exist in itself. I\\'m hoping that it doesn\\'t mean less durability than a heavier duty bag. We\\'ll see when the time comes.I\\'ll try to post a nice pic of it fully loaded to give you an idea of how much stuff will fit.', 6013: 'Good backpack not as many dividing pockets as I would have liked but for the price and size its over all a good bag', 6014: 'nice product. reasonable price. that makes me happy.I like it so much. thanks for good product.please make new design for me. ^^', 6015: 'Love this pair, great fit and look great.

The fit is comfortable and It is easy to wear,', 6025: \"As some of the other reviews said, I recommend ordering up a size.  I always wear a size small in sports bras (I'm a 34B bra size), and I don't mind a sports bra being pretty tight, so despite the reviews I decided to stick with size small.  I was happy with it at first despite being a little tight, but after a few washes it's even more snug (especially in the shoulder straps) and it actually causes me shoulder and neck pain if I wear it for too long. It's a good quality bra, cute colors and will last a long time, just make sure to order a size up if you don't want shoulder pain.\", 6026: 'I just had a baby and needed something that really works and this bra is great! I think I ordered one size bigger then i usally do but things tend to change when you have a little one and it fits great!', 6027: \"I've had a hard time finding running shirts that fit me, as many brands don't have or run out of XS quickly.

Like the color as well.', 6035: 'I got these pants on clearance and was lucky to get them in my size.  The are classy and comfortable.  I even got compliments on the golf course the first time I wore them. Just make sure you wear a solid colored navy blue or royal blue or white shirt with these pants.', 6036: \"I love oakleys, but the Flak jackets and Half jackets that I have worn just don't fit me and look weird on me. I went into an oakley outlet, and they have one pair of the asian fit fast jackets. OH GOD. I don't have to worry about the frame holding the frame loosely after change lenses over the years! The lens change system is quick, simple, and unless you totally lack common sense, intuitive.For asian guys, I really recommend these frames. For other races, they come with regular notepads too, so you can wear them normally.\", 6037: \"It's not easy to find a pair of Oakleys that will fit my face. While this is a stylish pair of sunglasses, it doesn't really look that good on me although I will still recommend it for any Asian friend to consider.\", 6038: \"My husband got me these sunglasses and while they are a bit of a splurge, they are worth every cent. The Fast Jacket glasses are very nice and lightweight making them super comfortable. The lenses for the sunglasses are perfect and everything outdoors looks crisp and clear while wearing them. There's absolutely no glare and they work exceedingly well in the bright sunshine.These Oakleys are very comfortable for biking, hiking, boating or any outdoor activity if you are into sports. They stay on because of their special design. There isn't anything I dislike about this pair of sunglasses. Oakley has the best and most specialized lens of any sunglasses I've owned. They also come with a nice carrying bag that doubles as a cleaning cloth. One should only use the cleaning bag to clean these lens. The lens are interchangeable and the special Switchlock changing system is very easy to use. The lens are open edged for great visibility and comfort, no matter what you are doing outside. They provide top rate UV protection for your eyes. The nose piece is very comfortable and vision is just super clear and great with these glasses. I also like the blue color of these. They are very unique, great looking and super comfortable. If you are active and need a super good pair of sunglasses, these definitely should be considered.\", 6039: 'Nice jacket with great quality; a bit large but it is ok.

On other websites people said these are too revealing, I disagree. The fabric feels heavier then any bikini I've ever had, like you could go to a waterpark without worrying about these bottoms flying off. I got the matching top and together they make an adorable vintageish bikini set that I can't wait to wear all summer! The quality seems to be very good, will update this after a summer of wear.\", 6042: \"I took the advice of the first reviewer and sized up one size.  I am 5'2 and 115 lbs and usually wear a small or a size 4.  A medium fits just right.  Most maxi dresses I have to alter since I am short but the ties keep it off the ground.  Great quality, thick fabric, decent price.\", 6043: \"Bought a large in this for my 34/36C frame, fits well but as others have said the straps are too long to put normally, you have to wear it racerback-style. I personally think it's cuter this way. I like the Gingham pattern but I wish they would have put something in the middle, like a stud or something just so it doesn't make your boobs look like a cavern so much. I will try to post a picture of me in this so you can kinda see what I mean! I think this top is good for large B cups and up!\", 6044: \"I am very happy with this purchase. I was a little skeptical at first, because of the &#34;Team USA&#34; logo printed on the bottom of the left lens, but it isn't even visible when you're wearing them unless you strain your eyes downward and leftward.

The color is awesome.  if you like this style buy them', 6048: 'Boots are nice and fit well but the color, I ordered coyote, was much darker than what is advertised.  They actually closer to a true coyote color which makes it easier to deal with not getting what is advertised.  Plus the color is all the same all over.  There are no darker areas like in the nylon mesh like pictured.  I guess this is what to expect with an Oakley boot, but from now on, I will stick to their sunglasses.', 6049: \"I got these boots for a 6 Week long intense training I had to go through. Very phyisical, a lot of running and other various activities. I love the look of the boots and they were super comfortable. They only made it through week one of the training. The leather on the toe's ripped open on day 3 of wearing them. Luckily Amazon is great and let me return them. For the money I spent I expected a lot more. It's too bad, I really loved the boots but just didn't hold up. If they weren't so exspenive I'd have exchanged them & just used them for the everyday stuff.\", 6050: \"I love these boots.

Great value.\", 6067: 'This model fits perfectly on on my face shape (typical asian woman). The long wait from US to Singapore is definitely worth the purchase. However, I think the polarised lens should be better in terms of visibility and sun-shade. Highly recommended!', 6068: 'i was really skeptical only because, based off the picture they dont look dark. Once you put them on they def darken outside. They arent that dark but they block light beautifully!!Super lightweight!!

These sunglasses look as stylish & good in real life as they do in the picture. The polarized lens was very nice. However, I was surprised at how large they were. The frame was wider than my face and took over. Size wise, I would classify these as extra large style.', 6086: 'I admit it.  I used to be a cheapskate when it came to buying sunglasses.  I was the person who bought the cheapest pair possible.  Then my husband mistakenly bought a pair of Oakley sunglasses.  He raved that they were the best sunglasses he ever had.  I tried them on, and I had to agree they were high quality.  So, I asked for a pair for my birthday.  I loved my Oakleys for two years, eight months.  Then, one day, I lost them shopping.(It makes me smile to think of the lucky person who found those.)  So I went to Oakleyvault.com for the past deal I could get and spent $95 plus tax for the first time in my life.  They fit well, look great and save my eyes from sun damage.

Yes, I'm sorry that the frames are now made in China, but I cannot complain about the quality.  They are light and smooth against my skin, and it's true that when I put them on top of my head, they do not catch my hair.  How do they do that?I like the fit, but I am a big girl, so I am not sure how they would look on a petite face.I've worn Oakley's for years and have always been happy with them.

These are my go-to glasses and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone!', 6102: \"actually bought these before even trying them on and they fit perfectly!!!! i have had polarized lenses before and had to have them again (once you have them, you won't go without them)love the color...goes with everything\", 6103: 'The Oakley Womens Overtime are exactly what I was looking for.  They are lightweight and have polarized lenses for reduced glare and have an ear and nose pad design that keeps the glasses from sliding off of your face during outdoor activities.', 6104: \"Love these sunglasses for running or just every day wear. I wore these for a marathon as well as beach vacation. They don't move and look great\", 6105: \"I have never had Oakley's and was nervous to buy something I hadn't tried on in the store.  I love these glasses!\", 6106: 'Love these glasses. I wear them running and on long bike rides. They are lightweight, no-slip and never fog up. So many of my sunglasses in the past have hurt my head after several hours on the bike, but not these. They are so comfortable, I hardly even notice them at all.  The nice wide frames allow for great vision and look cute for everyday wear. The gripping on the side and nose makes them stay put when leaning down to tie shoes, etc.  so I never lose or scratch them. Comes with a hard and soft case. Great buy!', 6107: \"My wife loves them.  Great look with a little Jacki O flare.  Great Valentine's gift.  Came with a nice white case.\", 6108: 'Bought the sunglasses for my wife and she just so loves it. This is what she has to say:Its a very sporty sunglasses and the fit is perfect for a round faced woman (judging by the fit on me and the amount of compliments i have received). Its light frames  with rubber nose and ear pads give it the &#34;stay put&#34; fit for an active lifestyle. The polarisation is excellent for the bright Nigerian sun. I will most definitely recommend this product. My husband hit the bulls eye this time....', 6109: 'I bought this sun glasses to my wife, and she is so happy the fit is perfect, the polarized is height definition... And She use every where!', 6110: 'These are just the right size - not too big or too small. They stay in place and fit nicely. I usually buy ray ban or other designer brand and this is my first pair of oakely and love them. I bought a second pair in case I lose this one!', 6111: \"It's perfect on face but it's not tidy on head.all in all I'm happy wear it when driving under sunshine day\", 6112: 'Love, love, love these. They stay on and are lightweight, comfy. I wore them paddleboarding and fell into the choppy water repeatedly and these never came off my face! And, I feel a little glam when I have them on. Great find.', 6113: 'Light, nice fit, takes a minute to get use to the polarization, but these are awesome for the Flordia sun!', 6114: \"I got these to replace my fives that were going on 10 years old....will be back to get my next pair of Oakley's.\", 6115: \"I was on the fence about spending this much on sunglasses but I'm glad i did. If your going to spring for something it might as well be for something that your going to wear on a daily basis.\", 6116: \"Look good and fit well. Great for skiing and golf. Even better price, you can't go wrong with these glasses.Cheers\", 6117: 'Product is exactly as I expected.  Fast delivery too.  The polarized glass is worth the extra as it really makes a difference.  I also like the way it does not pinch your head so you can wear them for a long period of time comfortably.', 6118: 'I love these glasses! They are so comfortable and I love the polarized. They are a rounded square shape - perfect for not wanting either. The frames are also not too big but they do cover a good amount. I am very picky and do not like big frames that look like bug eyes. These are great!! Can not say enough great things about them.', 6119: \"Oakley Women's Urgency Polarized Wrap Sunglasses is an excellent product protecting my eyes over and above any sunglasses you can buy over-the-counter.  It took a little while to get used to the yellow-tinted lenses but now I like them a lot.  They are pricy but if they fully protect my eyes, it will be worth what I paid.  The sunglasses fit my face comfortably and do not fall off when I bend over.  They are also very stylish. They come with a white case and microfiber cover.  This microfiber cover is to be used to wipe the lens clean.  I highly recommend these sunglasses to any woman who is seeking ultimate coverage from the suns damaging effects on their eyes.\", 6120: 'Bought these for my wife.  Gorgeous frame and great visibility. She looks fantastic in them! She looks forward to every sunny day!', 6121: \"Beautiful glasses, a bit fragile for my taste, I'm on time and without problems, all accessories and cloth bag leather very nice, excellent supplier, thanks, I'll take into account for my next purchase\", 6122: \"I have owned several pair of Oakley's in the past. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't see a problem with the quality. They are lighter weight than my others, but this actually makes them more comfortable to wear. The frames feel solid and the hinges operate smoothly and don't have any wiggle in them. The lenses are mounted snugly in the frame. They fit my medium face nicely and they have stayed put while wearing them boating, shopping and driving over the past several days. And, l like the fact that they are made in the U.S.A. I have no doubt these will serve me well for a long time to come, just as my other Oakley's have.\", 6123: 'The model is gorgeous and fits well in the face. the case is white and very beautiful too. I love it!', 6124: \"Look exactly as pictured.  Great lenses, light-weight on the face.  I'm very particular about my sun glasses and I really love these.\", 6125: \"Nice weight and washes well (no wrinkles). This is one of my son's favorite shirts. Still looks like new, even after several washes.\", 6126: \"She really like them and wears them all the time and she hasn't any complaints, wanted to get the limited edition but they got sold out\", 6127: \"These trunks are top notch.

I own two of them.  Oakley and LRG are by far the two best clothing/brands.  Enjoy these hoodies.', 6131: 'Overall it is what you would expect from the picture and price. I would probably buy it or similar again.', 6132: 'The color is great.  It is difficult to find a brown in &#34;sweat&#34; fabrics. The fabric weight is perfect for casual indoor wear.', 6133: 'My son loves this sweater so much I am thinking of having it tattooed on his body. Great quality just a bit pricey.', 6134: 'We get lots of cool mornings and even cool days in the summer here in Oakland.  This is just right.  Not too heavy.', 6135: 'I bought three.  The patterns are cool, they are soft, and the top pocket holds a cell phone completely with no flap standing up.', 6136: 'My son received this hoodie for Christmas.  It arrived as expected.  Sizing is accurate.  The hoodie fits well and my son loves it!', 6137: 'I got these for my husband for his birthday and he loves them. They fit well and are comfortable. They dry very fast and  are well made.', 6138: 'These are good looking shorts. I play volleyball in them, swim in them and run in them. They are very stretchable, almost rubbery, I like the material.', 6139: 'If you are in the military or DoD, you can buy these off usstanderdissue for very cheap, as I did. The frames, with clear prescription lenses and front and back anti-glare coasting were $140. Most everyone else can get them here on amazon for a vey reasonable price. I got these glasses and the quality is great. They are very sturdy, they look good, and they hug your face, so they never slip down your nose at all. I can barely feel them. The lenses are large enough that they cover up most of your view, but not bog enough to look nerdy. This was a great purchase. Oakley always seems to be!', 6140: \"Perfect small bag for my car.  This bag is small, so if you are looking for a hiking bag this is not it.The goods:-nice small bag w/ enough pockets-looks cool, I like the style-the outside pockets are large enough to be useful-the organizer pocket and straps can expand out to hold more if needed-other than the 2 outside side pockets, it has a side pocket for a 13&#34; laptop, kindle, ipad, notepad.  it also has a padded top pocket w/ a hole for your headphones and a small mesh pocket on the front.  these pockets can be accessed w/o undoing the clips.The bads:-'organizer pocket' is not completely sealed.  If I flip my bag over a few times the heavier items (bic lighter, small leatherman) fall out-if all is fastened, you gotta undo 3 buckles, fold the top back, then unzip to get into the main pouch.I would give this 5 stars if the organizer pouch was more secure.  An organizer pouch is supposed to organize and secure small items.  With this bag being so small, I tend to not always carry and place it upright.  I think I will add some velcro to 1 of the organizer pockets (the 1 that holds my lighter and leatherman) and it should be secure enough.\", 6141: 'my son wanted this for school but its just not large enough to carry his books. I know it says small in the description but it was smaller than we expected.', 6142: \"For my purposes, the bag is perfect.  I don't need to carry around a laptop or college books or anything huge.  I needed it purely as a man bag.  Carry deodorant, a knife,  mints, etc.  Essentials.  Occasionally lunch to work.  Slip my Kindle into the tablet exterior pocket.  For all that it works perfectly.The design build is great.  Should last years of being thrown around the car, work, etc.  Most importantly to me, it is masculine without being bulky and it did not look like it was for some 12 year old skater kid like most bags nowadays.The size isn't for everyone.  Like all niche bags, you should really check these out in stores first.Why it isn't a 5 star:- The top cover is kinda unnecessary.  The big zips closed, so I tend to not bother with it considering there are three buckles.  While the cover piece is well built, it seems to be more an aesthetic decision.  Not like it covers the entire zipper as to prevent rain getting through.- The real complaint is the front exterior.  There are two flaps that are velcroed together to reveal the organizer pocket.  This is completely weird and a bad design idea.  I am sure it was done for quick access, but they're flaps so if anything gets loose from the organizer it could potentially fall out from the top or bottom.  It wouldn't be the easiest thing for them to fall out, but don't put anything valuable or heavy in that area.  I only keep some pens and a flash drive there.  All in all, I don't even bother considering there are the two exterior zipper pockets to use.- Because the organizer is such a flop as detailed above, there isn't much organization obviously.  Not a big deal to me since I literally just throw things into it, but to some it could be a problem.All in all it is a good bag.  I was looking for a small bag that didn't look girly and when I found this I was super happy.  They are hard to find.  The bag doesn't deserve the 1 and 2 star reviews it is getting just because some people are surprised with what they got by ordering online.\", 6143: 'Its a small bag perfect for an overnight bag or for day trips. Very happy with my purchase. Tons of pockets and quality project.', 6144: \"I love this backpack. It is perfect for my needs but if your looking for something to hold your laptop this is not for you. Oakley sells the full size version of the Icon, which can accommodate a laptop. The &#34;small&#34; icon is meant/designed to hold your iPad or other full size tablet. There are plenty of pockets or storage areas for all kinds of stuff. I'm on my second one because unfortunately the build quality is poor. I owned the first one for about 2years and the zipper seams (iPad pocket and interior pocket) both split rendering the pockets useless.\", 6145: \"The person who wrote the pack is small, is right.  It is small, but for me fits everything I need every day without being too cumbersome, and it LOOKS cool.  What more can I say?  As for the straps, I never lock them, as the zipper and closed flap keeps everything in place.  I would only use the straps if I want absolute security or hiking a cliff or something.All the pockets and places to put stuff is great!I have an all-black one, and time-to-time, people stop me and ask where I've gotten this pack as they like the size and look.I've had this for years and use it nearly everyday, throw it around in the car, etc., and it's held up amazingly.  One strap has broken as it got yanked by the dog, and one zipper pull-tab has broken off, but I've been able to attach another pull in the zipper base.The backpack is kinda expensive, but I think it's been worth it.\", 6146: \"This is a superb bag for times when you don't need to carry the world.  For hiking, a nice small daypack.  For travel, an excellent pack for times when bulk needs to be limited.  I was able to fit a jacket and a parka (thin for the rain), camera, extra lens, gps, cell phone, batteries, a book (not small), several small misc. items and there is room left over.  The shoulder straps could be more substantial and I would not recommend this for a hike of long duration unless you beef up the thickness of the straps.\", 6147: \"The bag is used by my girlfriend1. Tablet pocket - great, can be also used for documents , easy access2. A small pocket in the bag's top cover - fits IPhone perfectly while rollerblading.3. Side pockets - good for keys & change.4. Organizer part... rarely used... it is not secure enough, cuz  there is no zipper closure... if you have something not important and valuable  (cigarettes, small bottle of water, etc)  - you can put it there5. The largest compartment can hold a pair of sneakers, a gopro with a telescopic monopod, t-shirt, a litre bottle of water.6. Rollerblades with 80mm radius wheels can be attached7. Good looking :)A bit small for its price (in my point of view), but the girl is happy and likes it alot :)\", 6148: 'The backpack is small, but definitely quality.  This picture makes it seem bigger than the actual size, enough where I was surprised when it arrived.  We plan to keep it because of the quality.', 6149: \"It's a small backpack exactly what I needed and it looks cool. When I say it's small it literally small if you are trying to put books in here you are gonna need something bigger the bag is for quick trips where you don't want to carry things in your pockets or when your girlfriend asks you to carry her stuff as well. I use it for my camera stuff when I only need about 2 lenses and it works perfect.\", 6150: \"Outstanding quality, good looking and works perfect for a daily basis use like gym, biking or jus walking around the city not for students don't get me wrong bag pack is small but still you can't go wrong !\", 6151: \"I have three Oakley bags. This light duty bag is perfect for riding around in the summer on the dirt bike, or going on a hike / walking tour.

There is also a separate compartment behind the main bag for an iPad.\", 6152: 'This is a nice small backpack. It is small but just what I needed I am very happy with it.', 6153: 'I have been using these small Oakleys as purses for many years but had finally worn through my last one.  The really small version was discontinued but I found this slightly bigger size and thought I would give it a try.  It really works great and the slightly bigger size is actually convenient for carrying around my kindle, extra eyeglasses, and other things that made my other Oakley less useable.  I will probably stock up on these just in case Oakley stops making these suckers!', 6154: \"Gave this to my brother for christmas, he's been wanting a smaller book-bag for when he goes out to take his iPad with him.

Holds allot more then you would think. Zippers, buckles, and Velcro all real strong. Used it as a hunting pack and for my track bag and I have loaded that thing to full capacity and had no tears breaks or rips. No problems with it yet.', 6157: 'I use this pack when I am snowboarding to carry all of my Go Pro gear, extra goggles, chap stick, hand sanitizer and summit treats!It is small enough to not get in the way and perfect for riding all day.  It has a top pocket for storing your iPod, phone or anything you want access to quickly.  Sits perfectly when riding a motorcycle, snowboarding, skiing.A very well made pack!', 6158: 'very good the material is very nice, item is good quality, only thing is made in guatemala. this is the first after that i bought two more.', 6159: \"I paid a much higher price from Amazon before, If I had picked them up for the price listed now I might give it 5 stars. Kinda light weight and flimsy for my retail price. But with the light weight material I cant say they have disassembled yet, but I havent put them through any reefs yet. Pretty nice fit and comfortable. Not bad...the current price is $17 something for that price id say pick'em up and they might receive 5 stars from future buyers. Just note your gona be surprised at the light weight material, weather that will be good or bad for you, don't know..... Oh water proof zipper maybe, but the Pocket isnt...haha\", 6160: \"I bought these to dive in summer months, but haven't had a chance to use them for that purpose.

The clarity of the lenses seems excellent as does the fit and finish of the frames. So far they are doing an excellent job. I been running them up here in VT, lots of bright sun reflecting off of very white snow - a great way to really find out what your sun shades are made of. These Oakley's have had no problem with the sun or the super bright glare (think snow blind) coming off the ground. This is my first pair of Oakley's. I've had all the others - ray ban, bolle, Serengeti etc. These are nice glasses. Would buy Oakley's again. Only gripe - spend this much on glasses and they should come with a hard case.\", 6171: 'Great pair of sunglasses, no complaints!Sturdy build quality, great lenses, large tan lines. What more could you ask for?!', 6172: \"Can't beat the quality of Oakleys. Love these glasses. The Fire Iridium lenses are quite an attention getter and the accents on the frames make for a perfect color balance.\", 6173: 'I love these glasses. I wish they made them in more then just this color. I will definitely keep looking to see if they do. They fit well, and look much better then traditional aviators.', 6174: \"I've been a big fan of Oakley for years, and wanted something flashy for this pair, and these just happened to be 50% off at the time so I picked up a pair.As typical for Oakley, the lenses are perfect.  The frames are well made, straight, and the ear-socks are nice and smooth.  For those who've never slipped on a pair with even small sharp edges on near the back, it's a big deal to have them perfectly smooth.But I have to give Oakley -1 star for the frame on the right lens, it has a little give to it, maybe 1/2MM, but enough to notice, you can squeeze the frame around the screw, and the screw is in tight, I've tried it a couple of times.  I had to remove the screw, shorten it a bit, and put it back in before it would pull the frame tight.  Not great QC, Oakley.  Yeah, I could have sent them in to get fixed/replaced, but this was an easy one, and I didn't want to deal with the shipping hassle.Overall, I love these, the combination of the orange and chrome is just the right amount of flashy I was looking for.\", 6175: \"Got this y'day. As everyone has said, Very good quality product. Love the embossed small letters Oakley written on the bridge. nice classy touch.My past 2 glasses are both Oakley's. So i appreciate their quality and style a lot.Note: Warm grey = dark brown. I was hoping it would've been actually dark grey or even black.Might return these and see if I can order silver or black, as I own almost no brown. Everything in my wardrobe is black, blue, white and accessories are black or silver.Reducing one point, becuase description confused me.Will recommend though.

The cloth bag is a joke (should only be used for lens cleaning). An additional $20 - $25 for an Oakley brand case is silly at this price point.That said, you've already paid $250 for them, might as well fork over a bit more to protect them from accidental damage.Great build quality, super light weight (titanium), amazingly clear lenses (polarized tungsten iridium).I was at a stop light earlier and lifted up my glasses to see the difference; The rear windshield of the car in front of me was completely obstructed with sun reflecting. It was like a mirror, I couldn't even see into the car. But with the glasses on, I saw through the car all the way to the car in front of them like the glare wasn't even there. Amazing lenses.\", 6189: 'Very comfortable to wear. nice contrast of all colors/ The polarized screen of TV or radio is difficult to view, so tilt the elens above your eyes!', 6190: \"I've been a believer in quality sunglasses for many years now, and these fit right in.The optical clarity is just what you'd expect from Oakley and the titanium frames weigh next to nothing.  There are bendable segments near the ear socks to help customize fit, and the nose pieces can be bent for fit as well.Style is subjective, but I have no problem wearing these when dressed up or down, unlike my Juliets which are strictly casual, or my Ray Ban Aviators which feel more dressed up.  These strike a balance of classic and modern, just like Oakley says they do.That said, for $250 they could include at least a customized storage bag with them.  Included storage consists solely of the small black bag that Oakley puts with all their glasses.  I'm not complaining and they don't lose points in my book, but it would have been nice to see.The brown lens option is FANTASTIC.  It's less red than Smith's brown lenses, about on par with the brown lens from Electric Visual, but a bit darker and polarized.  Easily one of, if not THE best lens tint I've ever used.\", 6191: 'First time in a long time that I have payed full retail for anything....and it was worth every penny.  I love the look, feel, and optics of these glasses.  I am very happy with the purchase!', 6192: \"Those Oakley sunglasses are nice.

The retro aviator look with the contemporary frame is sweet!  I love the polarized lenses!  They are super light too!  Highly recommend!', 6194: 'Jury is out on whether it is worth the price.  The glasses are very comfortable, and the cooler quality when looking through the lenses are fantastic.  Downside is the price and the fact that there is no case for the glasses.', 6195: \"Excellent sunglasses.  Very light and comfortable. Larger than I thought. Does not come with a case and it's made in China.\", 6196: \"I've worn Oakleys for a number of years and these are the most comfortable pair that I've ever worn. The lightweight frames feel like I'm barely wearing anything and the lenses provide good coverage for sunlight coming anywhere but straight from the side. Polarized lenses take a little getting used to as they prevent you from seeing some screens like at the ATM. The also cause window tinting to look splotchy. But those minor inconveniences are worth it for all the advantages they provide. While these glasses certainly aren't cheap, the quality and comfort are worth it to me.\", 6197: \"Purchased the titanium/tungsten lenses version.  Love the lens shade - brown is my favorite as they contrast colors, look good and are great for driving.  The polarized tungsten iridium offers a 'medium' level of visible light blockage which is good as they are not too dark or bright - middle of the road.These glasses look cool and are on the smaller side of men's aviators - I'm not a fan of huge aviators which extend over the edges of my face.  These lenses curve and wrap fully over my eyes allowing very little direct sunlight in as many of the smaller lensed glasses do.Being titanium, these are extremely light and combined with the air filled nose pads - they are very comfortable.The lenses seem like they are thin so don't drop these!No, they do not come with a hard case - which sucks for the price point - but few brand name glasses do.  Most oakley/ray bans come in the cloth bag in a cardboard box.  The premium is for the ultra-light and durable titanium material though.Speaking with an associate in the Oakley store, replacement lenses are not available for these and they have to be sent in for such work which really stinks.  The frames will far outlive the lenses so it'd be nice to stock an extra pair of lenses and not have to send these into oakley in 2-3 years for any lens change.  Maybe that will change?  This is something that really bugs me and I might not have purchased these if I had known prior.Pros:-Very light-Polarized lenses-Look greatCons:-Expensive-Replacement lenses not available\", 6198: 'The product was delivered on time, as expected, and the style and feel are top notch! I love the look and highly recommend these glasses. Lightweight and stylish at a reasonable price.', 6199: 'My title says it all. Oakley optics are awesome and the polarization is excellent.The only two things that you might not like are: they are a bit heavy and a bit too dark (only useful on very sunny days).', 6200: 'I really liked the glasses, I found beautiful, lightweight, the lens is very good. A product design with bold and very cool! I recommend to everyone!', 6201: \"I'm skinny at 20 years old with a small face so it was the perfect fit. These crystal clear shades are comfortable and durable. The moment I put them on, I knew that the Oakley's would last forever. They arrived in only 2 days. This really could be your best buy on amazon like for me, just make sure you have a smaller face. If you notice any discomfort, that is merely due to eye strain (which I noticed first). It is not caused by the glasses. The tint is so different from my old shades that my eyes simply had to adjust. I highly recommend this stylish pair to anyone whether you play sports or not.\", 6202: 'They are nice, cool and comfortable. they are very light, i have used to run and MTB and no regrets! Im very happy with my purchase.', 6203: \"These are very nice looking sunglasses! I bought a pair for my son for his b day and he is 13. Well, his dad LOVED THEM! So when Father's Day rolled around guess what Daddy got?  Both my guys treat them extra careful and put them in the cloth case that comes with them and talk about two HANDSOME LOOKING MEN when they have them on! My husband said they fit really well and you get good sunlight coverage. They are very lightweight so he said they don't make your face &#34;sweat&#34; where they lay on pressure points or cause any indents or redness on skin. Well worth the extra money spent to get a high quality product!!\", 6204: 'Not only do I love these b/c no one has a pair like these, but everyone likes them for the same reason!', 6205: \"A sleek pair of glasses.  I liked that the lens are dark enough that you can't see your eyes.  Easily fits.\", 6206: \"I have a long, narrow face and it's hard to find glasses that wrap around my face nicely. I had the original Half Jacket's a few years ago when I was in the Army and the new Half Jacket 2.0 are essentially the same with a little more modular look. The Unobtainium nose and temple pads are comfortable and make the glasses grip better. They don't slide as much when sweating as compared to glasses without any nose or temple padding. Both these with the rounded lenses and the Half Jacket 2.0 XL with the angular lenses look great so that choice is really up to you it comes down to preference. But if you have a narrow face then the Half Jacket 2.0 or the Straight Jacket are the way to go.\", 6207: \"I have two pairs if these sunglasses one is the pearl frames with violet iridium lenses and the other is black frame with violet iridium lenses. I was unsure if I would like the iridium lenses but I love them.  I can see outside more clearly and when I walk into a building I don't have to immediately take them off because I can still see through them. The frames are very light weight and stay in place on my nose and ears.\", 6208: \"These sunglasses fit perfectly. I measured them against my old Oakley's, so I felt confident to order them. I love the nonslip material on these glasses, so they don't slip off your cap while bending over. They are lightweight, and sometimes you forget you are wearing them! Two replaceable nose pieces are included. These Oakley sunglasses are much better than the old design which I had bought 10 years ago. A happy golfer!\", 6209: \"Great stylish sunglasses. They are really nice and useful for outdoor activities and light. You don't feel that you have them on.They definitely worth the price and are good quality\", 6210: 'I love my Oakleys. They are exactly what I was looking for. They shipped quickly and I received them in perfect condition.', 6211: 'These were purchased for my 14 year old son.  They fit him perfectly.  The interchangable lenses are a great idea.  I only wish I had bought the polarized version, but I could not spend the extra $60 at the time.', 6212: \"these sunglasses are great. its hard to find sunglasses to fit me because they always look big on my face. these fit perfectly and don't look ridiculous. i would recommend them to those who have a smaller head like mine.\", 6213: \"I decided on these Half Jacket 2.0's with the XL lenses as a lower-cost replacement to a pair of Oakley Flak Jackets that I lost, and they are exactly what I expected at a GREAT price. Lightweight, good optics, and the model is the one that I ordered. I'm not sure what the issues were with some of the reviews on this product, by mine was spot-on.\", 6214: \"I had another pair of these for over 10 years (last pair was polarized, however) and they're great.  Great fit and sun protection.\", 6215: 'I love Oakley glasses and the 2.0 are evan better than the originals. Defenetly the best sunglasses I have ever bought.', 6216: 'excellent quality product, excellent leather and finish, very good is what I expected, good looks and high quality finish, excellent quality product', 6217: \"These are very light-weight and have great optics.  Unfortunately though, they were just too snug on my head.  My head isn't particularly wide, but these are clearly meant for someone smaller.  I returned them and got the Flak Jackets instead.  The Flak Jackets fit great.  My advice, if you have a smaller face the halfs are fine.  If not, check out the Flaks instead.\", 6218: \"Fit great and look even better! Wasn't sure about the color but it looks like I am on fire! Love\", 6219: 'the non polarized finish is not as good as iridium quality. should try the first. but in the other hand i might be used to the iridium shade as my former 5 oakley has been gold iridium', 6220: 'They fit good and tight around my head so no worry about them falling off in the boat or playing softball, but no too tight as to be uncomfortable.  They do however sit a little high on my nose but otherwise really good.', 6221: \"I will be styling this summer on the road and trail. Black Iridium even works on partly cloudy days. Wouldn't recommend trail riding in shaded areas on cloudy days as the imperfections could become hard to decifer.\", 6222: 'Excellent product, very good and very good quality. Stuff and high capacity protection in pumoles and nose. I recommend 100 %', 6223: 'I have used the Half Jackets for running, cycling, and golfing. They stay in place even during heavy sweating conditions. I ordered these frames because Oakley offers prescription lenses for them through local and online optometrists. Getting the frames from Amazon will save you some money.', 6224: \"was able to purchase these for the same price as the Oakley store and didn't have to travel to a store miles away\", 6225: \"Fits exactly how the original Half Jacket did. Unfortunately I left mine on the roof of the car and drove off. I was skeptical since it's impossible to try them on first but the fit is perfect. Like the original, if you like the style and can't stand no name brands rubbing your eyelashes, get these. You won't regret it. The ear socks are much less noticeable and should deform less over time than the original which I count as a bonus too.\", 6226: \"I'm 6'0 and 150 lbs Ironman triathlete...with a thin face.  These things fit perfectly!  The quality is exceptional, as one would expect from Oakley\", 6227: 'No good for people with a hight nose, if you have no nose then they will fit perfectly , god material', 6228: \"I bought these as a replacement of a pair of my dad's that I lost. They fit him great and he loves them even more than the original pair he had.\", 6229: 'Bought these to replace an older set of half jacket 1.0.  I was a bit disappointed that I could no longer get the 1.0 but these are great and nearly identical and up the plus side I was able to order replacement lens for my older pair.  I have never owned a pair of sunglasses as durable or well made as Oakley.', 6230: 'Great pair of glasses, as expected and really quick postage. Will shop more in the near future, real happy purchase.', 6231: 'I have worn half jackets for years. Great for running, climbing, whaterver. They stay put and do their job. These lenses are really nice. Looking through them in shadowy late afternoon light, the light seems warmer that  the light seen through the Oakley fire lenses. It makes for better contrast in late afternoon. I am really happy with these.', 6232: \"I've had this brand of Oakley before, this first pair lasted 6 years. Replaced lenses once on that pair. Lost them in a hay field, bummer!\", 6233: \"I just had cataract surgery last fall and am now aware of the need for good glasses while I'm on the golf course. These glasses not only protect the eyes, they allow me to see the ball better--and they look great!\", 6234: 'Love these, this is my second pair since I lost my first pair on a vacation in Cancun. My only quibble with these glasses is the rubber molding tends to move around and makes me worry it will fall off (even though it stays put).', 6235: 'This is a great sport sunglass. And it looks so cool, especially when the sun light shines on the orange glasses. Besides, the price is awesome.', 6236: 'This is the first time I have spent this kind of money on sunglasses and only because they were for a Christmas present. They seem to be very sturdy so hopefully they will hold up to the rigors of baseball. Just hoping they last!!', 6237: 'nice', 6238: 'What can one say about it other than - great, stylish, pricey, fits well when I ride my road bike; light weight; almost forget you have it on sometimes.', 6239: 'They fit me well, Oakley recommend not to use them while driving, possibly something to do with misinterpreting traffic signals but the colour change of traffic lights when wearing these is negligible.', 6240: \"I got these for my husband for his birthday, he was so happy! They look great on him. When I got the box and opened it to inspect them before wrapping I was a little worried that they might be snug on his face. They look a little on the small side. But I didn't have enough time to exchange them.  When he finally opened his gift I have to say they look amazing on him, he was so happy! The glasses are very light weight great for bike riding. I'm really happy that I picked these.\", 6241: 'Work at a pool in the summer and definitely needed a nice pair of sunglasses. These are worth the money because they fit very well and have the right amount of tint!', 6242: \"Love my shades.  I have a pair of Flak Jackets already and bought this Half Jackets and couldn't be happier.  They make for a great alternative!\", 6243: \"I bought these as a gift to my husband and he LOVES them! They look awesome on his face and he says they're really comfortable.\", 6244: \"Quality eyewear isn't something I mind paying for but Oakleys carry a price tag above the norm.  I usually wear Wiley-X or Gargoyles for this reason.  After a long hiatus from Oakley I came back this time for one reason... I couldn't find any styles I liked in the other two.I like them a lot and if they could keep the price at $100 I'd probably rate them 5 stars but as I titled this review, the current prices are too high for this product.As to durability, I've babied these and the free clam shell it came with has followed me everywhere.\", 6245: \"I used to be that guy who bought lots of pairs of knock offs, thinking i break sunglasses too often to buy quality.  I've changed my tune as these lasted throughout a very active summer, no scratches, crystal clear, worth the money, i'm never going back\", 6246: \"I am an avid runner and bought these to replace another brand that broke after about a year and 1/2 of use. The half jacket is very light weight and comfortable. My first run with these was 19 mile trail run that climbed about 3000 feet in elevation. The half jacket never bounced around, slipped, and stayed comfortable for the entire run. For a fitted hat, I wear about a size 7....sometimes a 6 and 7/8 and these sunglasses have just a little room, but fit very well. If you have a wider face you will probably want to look at the other models. For me, I am happy to be back in a pair of Oakley's and will probably stay with them from now on.\", 6247: 'These are a great improvement, much lighter and more comfortable.  Love it when an upgrade is actually an upgrade, nice work oakley.', 6248: 'Nice looking  glasses. Fit snug lenses in right. Wish it came with a case for that price. Look great on.', 6249: 'awsome pair of glasses really clear ive been wanting a pair for a long time and they had best price', 6250: 'This sunglasses are great. They reminded me of an old pair that I use to have and they block the sun great!', 6251: 'Work offshore these block out a lot more sun than other brands I have tried a bit small for my face but not uncomfortable', 6252: \"I've been wearing the Oakley Half Jackets for years, had several pairs of them during both military time and civilian time. I lose them from time to time (never had a pair break) and recently lost another pair in a river, so I ordered the 2.0 XL set. These are much nicer than the older version; the fit seems better and the frame is flexible, which should make for a more stable platform as well as a more comfortable one. They are bulletproof as ever, I only wish they could come up with some way to keep me from losing them...I will continue using these for as long as I can get them, and the 2.0 XL is a nice advancement from the older style.\", 6253: 'I bought these for the misses. She really didn\\'t care for any of the women\\'s styles of Oakley sunglasses. I have the Flak jacket XLJ\\'s that I love, but they are way to big for her small build. After reading the reviews and the \"these are for smaller faces\" comments, I decided to give these a try for her. She loves em! They fit great, she says they are very comfortable and can be worn for long lengths of time. The design and rubber arms/nose piece make them really stay in place, which is very important to us since we do a lot of kayaking and outdoor activities. My only complaint is that they only came in the material bag and did not come with the hardshell zipper case.', 6254: \"I love these. They fit my average sized head perfectly. Lightweight and comfortable. I purchased these because the wife claims my Ray-bans went out of style in the 80's. Not sure about that. Very happy with these though. Highly recommended.\", 6255: 'All I can say is awesome! These fit great, and look great! Very happy with my new Oakleys! Buy them for yourself now!', 6256: \"I like the style of these. I was taken aback because the did not come with the alternate lens. Never the less, you can't go work with Oakleys\", 6257: \"My husband was so excited to get these for his birthday. He'll be using them when he does his cycling.\", 6258: \"Great gift! My hubby's favorite sunglasses! I bought cheap ones last year and they don't compare to these Oakleys, thanks!\", 6259: \"Got these glasses a couple weeks ago and they are great. As previous people mentioned about the lenses scratching easily, I have not ran into that problem. Use them for driving, coaching, etc., and haven't had any issues with them falling.\", 6260: \"Purchased these as a gift for my husband. They are well worth the cost- well-built and sturdy, they're also very good-looking. My husband does have a narrow face so they fit perfectly but I could see how someone with a wider face (like myself) might find them uncomfortable.Only drawback is there is zero wrap to the side so any sun on the sides isn't blocked at all.\", 6261: 'these are the only sunglasses I will wear', 6262: 'I recently picked up these Oakley Half Jacket 2.0 glasses. They fit my head perfectly. Not too tight, just right. I would describe my head as an average male head.I have had these glasses about two weeks and have used them at the pool, the beach, playing 18 rounds of golf and working outside around the house. I have had no comfort issues at all and even when sweating and moving around the frames stay put.The lenses are extremely sharp and clear with very good visibility. They are also interchangeable which is very cool. I have not switched out the lenses yet but I have tried removing the existing lenses and the process is very easy,I would recommend these sunglasses and look forward to years of good use.', 6263: 'They fit perfect and are very lightweight  good price also. Len is nice and dark to protect from sun.good buy', 6264: 'Great sunglasses!  Light-weight yet well constructed. These are the sunglasses you see championship ball players wear. Oakley makes the best sunglasses!', 6265: 'Great optics, fit perfectly, and they stay on very well. Even wore them on a very intense rollercoaster, and had no issues at all. So comfortable I can were them all day long and not have them bother me in the least. Highly recommended.', 6266: 'Thanks, love them.  They are exactly as described, love them.  The fit is wonderful.  I also love that the lens are interchangeable.Thanks', 6267: 'These sunglasses look good and fit good. They are great for snowboarding. Will stay on your head during sports. They are great for snowboarding', 6268: 'I like the stile, very lite in weight, and overall a great purchase. I will recommend to others. Packaging was also very nice.', 6269: \"Maybe a little overpriced, but if you're buying Oakley you should have cash to spare. I love them, and they are of very high quality, and most importantly block some sun rays and look freakin sexy.\", 6270: \"My boyfriend and I own several sets of Oakley's. I preferred the old Half Jacket standard lenses, and these didn't look as good on me. They look fine on my boyfriend, though, and they were a great price, so we kept them. Can't go wrong with them!\", 6271: 'I got sick of purchasing cheaper sunglasses that fit and feel ok (generally too tight or too loose) and break after a few months, which drives me crazy.I did research on sunglasses and decided to pick up a pair of Oakley sunglasses after visiting their shop. I tried on a number of Oakley sunglasses and decided on the half jacket 2.0 because I have a small face. I have been very happy with the purchase. They feel and fit great.', 6272: 'I don\\'t understand the negative reviews, these are great.  A new version of the Half Jacket, they fill a perfect niche between the Flack Jacket and Half Jacket.  I found the quality to be equally excellent as other Oakleys I have owned.  I believe \"oval\" in the description refers to the frames and not the lenses. The pictures and desriptions clearly show if the lenses are the traditional rounded, or the larger XL or XLJ which are more angular.  I have waited a long time for Oakley to come out with the G30 lense (golf specific)in a polarized version, so these are perfect for me. An added bonus is that the lenses are interchangeable with the very popular Oakley Flack Jacket frames, which gives you a lot options.', 6273: 'Just great', 6274: 'Great buy. Comfortable and well made. A tad pricy but well worth it. If absolutely buy another pair in the future.', 6275: 'Fits well. Great for cycling.', 6276: \"Best sunglasses I've ever owned.  No more Ray Bans or Costas for me.  Lightweight but sturdy, and they stay on my face without any slippage at all when sweating.  Without a doubt the best lenses I've ever had, they're spectacular.  It's like the difference between regular TV and HDTV.  Expensive but worth the money, I highly recommend, especially if you're active in the sun.\", 6277: \"The Oakley Half Jacket 2.0 glasses I ordered were a replacemnt for an older pair I had for approximately five years. They're at the bottom of a lake now but the new ones have an updated style that looks equally as good as the top of the line &#34;Radar Lock&#34; model. The delivery was unbeleivably quick and the packaging was clean and dent free.\", 6278: 'These sunglasses are great, they look smart, the bright orange and gray colors are terrific and the lenses provide the right amount of protection.', 6279: 'Got these for my Girlfriend at an unbeatable price, would have been 180 in a sunglass hut.  Only downside is the soft case given the general fragility of oakleys in general', 6280: \"I had always used the $10 cheap clear lens glasses from hardware stores for my cycling.  While these worked well in normal and dark conditions I had nothing for bright sunny days and the cheap frames did nothing for my cycling image.  If you want a pair of really great looking and cycle-ready frames...give these some real consideration.  Many pros use these frames so they have hold up to some heavy use.  I've only used mine for a few rides but they seem well made and highly durable.  The lenses can be swapped out as well.  I highly recommend.\", 6281: 'My husband seems to love these.  He mountain bikes and  was having a problem with a full frame fogging up especially while used in conjunction with his helmet.  These seem to eliminate that problem.  They look cool too. He rides in the woods so he ordered clear lenses to replace the mirrored.', 6282: 'The sunglasses were great. What I expected. Fits & looks good. I like the wrap around for my eyes.Arrived on timeThank you,  Tom Adeimy', 6283: 'As described and the fit is superb. Oakley glasses are some the best especially with the new polarized lenses for driving and biking.', 6284: 'Over the years, I have owned a number of sunglasses from Bolle to Oakley to Spy.  Oakley is the best glasses I have owned.  They are comfortable, stylish, and stand up to the wear of use and longevity.Pros:- Comfortable- Light Weight- Durable- Crystal Clear with the Polarized LensesCons:- Pricy', 6285: \"I purchased this pair of sunglasses after being fed up with buying cheapo $20 sunglasses and constantly breaking them.I'm really impressed with the quality of the lenses and frame. Nice rubber on the arms to keep them in place, and a nice touch for Oakley to include different nosepads according to the wearer's nose size. Lenses really get the job done (black iridium), blocks out enough of the sun to an extreme level of comfort while retaining clarity of the scape. Also reduces a huge amount of the glare that regularly causes discomfort and stress of the corners of the eyes. I'm an athletic trainer, and I'm out at football practice every day watching the players, so you can imagine how much a godsend some eye protection is during the summer months.A little disappointed with the rather tight fit. I admit I do have a more circular and oval shaped face, but after a couple weeks, really got used to them, and the size is not much of a problem anymore.\", 6286: 'Fit nicely as usual. My number one choice OAKLEY.', 6287: 'PERFECT FOR RUNNING,AND OUT DOORS SPORTS, LIKE FISHING OR HIKING , ONE OF THE BEST SUNGLASSES AT A VERY GOOD PRICE', 6288: 'I bought these for working in Afghanistan in the bright sun and they do an excellent job of protecting my eyes. They also wrap around to give me almost full coverage which I like in a pair of glasses. If these get scratched, i will be replacing the lenses. I love them', 6289: 'Great glasses. Fit snug. Speedy delivery. I could see my reflaction in the lenses. Any pair of Oakleys is worth every penny.', 6290: \"These are great sunglasses, and the polarized lenses are amazing. They are pretty light and they do have a slight clingy fit to them but that seems to serve as a way to secure on them on you while you're being active. I would purchase this style again if i had too.\", 6291: 'My husband bought these because of the great price.  He was replacing a pair he lost in the ocean (very sad day).  He loves his Oakleys.  They have paid for themselves as compared to the cheap sunglasses he used to be every month after breaking them.  He wears sunglasses every day.  He drives a truck all day, so they get a lot of use.', 6292: \"I can't seem to buy any other brand for the last 14 years. I wish Oakley would make decent frames again with small lenses. Today everything seems to be getter larger.I like Oakley because of the durability of the frames I have been using for the last few years. So far I'm happy with my decision to get these glasses.\", 6293: \"I have owned over the years severely over-priced Maui Jim's, Ray-Ban's, and everything in-between. I have no idea why I stayed away from Oakley sunglasses other than the fact that some I had tried just didn't look good on my face. well, that's all changed and I don't think I will ever buy another brand again. I simply love these sunglasses. They are beyond comfortable,look great, and most importantly give me clear vision.\", 6294: 'I love Oakley sunglasses and just replaced my last pair that were 6 years old. There is nothing to dislike but the delivery service which is not up for comment here. Amazon is awesome!', 6295: 'I use these sunglasses as my riding glasses for my Harley.

Highly recommended especially for people who drive.', 6297: 'Light; serves it purpose; a bit priceless but it is Oakley; stylish and got great compliments from my friends; use it alot for riding my road bike.', 6298: 'Man these Oakleys look good, they feel good and the cost a lot less than the store at the mall.', 6299: 'These are Asian fit and come with large nose pieces, but also come with small nose pieces you can replace the large noses pieces. I have a big head, and these fight snugly, but no overly tight like some other sunglasses I have purchased in the past. Love the amber color, filters out the glaring blue light and polarization helps with glare even more. Not too dark either, you can wear these in bight and cloudy days. These were exactly what I was looking for and the price was great.', 6300: 'I had worn our jsut about every piece(pads, lenses, etc) on my Oakley Half Jackets and was going to buy a replacement pair but saw that Oakley came out with a 2.0 version.I figured why not?They are just a bit different than the originals.  Larger lenses but certainly not aviator lens large.Still great comfort and they stay solidly on my face even during sports.  Great sunglass', 6301: 'bought these last spring because i lost my old $20 pair. been loving them ever since, great sunglasses, very durable and scratch resistant. have no regrets for paying around $150.', 6302: \"I'll preface by saying I'm a die hard loyal fan of Oakley after trying other brands in the past. That said, I did much research and tried on a great deal of styles before settling on these.I wanted Oakleys that were not too huge on my face, stylish, but gave a wrap-around feel to block out the sun from the sides. I ordered the black lens as Oakley quoted it as the best percentage for blocking UV rays. I also did not want the XL or XLJ options, which is just a description of the shape of the LENS, nothing more. The oval lens were a little smaller and sat above my cheek unlike the other lenses which kept hitting my cheek. If you're outside sweating, this may be a good thing, so the lens doesn't get grimy and wet.I got the polarized lens because of the awesome deal amazon had. In comparison, I have still not seen a huge difference from my old, non polarized Oakleys and these. One annoyance with the polarization is I cannot see my car's radio display and other digital displays (some cel phones). You either have to tip your head to the side, or lift your glasses up.Because there is no frame on the bottom of the lens, you will get fingerprints and the occasional moisture from sweat or natural body oil on the bottom rims. I HIGHLY recommend using Oakley cloth and cleaners for this.The arms have rubberized feature for better grip on your head. While this is great, if you have longer hair at all, be VERY careful when you take your glasses off. I noticed my hair will catch on the rubber and pull (ouch). However, this is not NEARLY as bad as the Flak Jacket, which I passed up solely on after 4 tries, I pulled out my hair every time. This also goes for the nose piece, with it's rubberized area, it could get caught on your hair if you wear your Oakleys on your head.Even with these small setbacks, I can go out in bright sun without squinting too much, they offer large coverage and I know UV rays are not damaging my eyes. They do not shift and fit very snugly on my face. I don't have to worry about any activity I choose to do (jogging, softball, yard work, etc.), they will not move. They feel sturdy as I plan to keep them for several years.\", 6303: 'Oakley always delivers! This polarized high definition optics is everything the eyes need for the sunny outdoors! It also brings sexy back!', 6304: 'I\\'ve always loved the Oakley \"Jacket\" glasses.  The frames seem to last forever and I can always pick up replacement or different lenses depending on my activity.These were great to have in deployed locations.  I would change between clear and smoke lenses for day or night missions.  Always great to have a little eye protection.  They did save my right eye once, I\\'m not sure how much damage my eye would have taken, but it would not have been pleasant.', 6305: 'they are replacing a pair of Oakleys I paid 220.00 for that broke in 4 months(the fast jackets) I take care of my shades but the fastjackets broke nonetheless. I would never buy oakley change outs(fastjackets agian) they are not designed properly and will break. these shades are bulletproof on the other hand and are great.', 6306: 'I work outside landscaping and there is no better product for you eyes.  Great in the shade or in full sun the polarized HD quality is the best!', 6307: 'Great pair of sunglasses. looking to buy some replacement lenses for these glasses in the near future. Would purchase again.', 6308: 'This was a fantastic purchase at a great price.  They do a great job blocking the sun and the price for a polarized pair of sunglasses is outstanding.  They fit great and I have no issues with them fogging up during a run.  Very satisfied with this purchase', 6309: \"These are the best sunglasses I have ever owned.  Completely removes the glare from the dash on the front windshield.  Very comfortable and won't slip off your face\", 6310: 'Never had Oakleys. The hype is justified.  I bought these for road biking, and they are perfect.  Will buy more Oakley products.', 6311: 'The sunglasses themselves are great.  The frame is lightweight enough that sometimes you forget they\\'re even there.  As advertised, the rubber material on the frame is non-slip and keeps everything in place.  When I purchased my frames from Amazon, I selected the \"Polished Black Frame/Black Iridium Polarized Lens\" listed under the \"color\" option, but the full description consistently said, \"Polarized: no\" regardless of the selected color option.  Amazon\\'s free returns policy gave me more confidence in making my purchase and when the shipment did arrive, it was precisely the \"Oakley Mens Half Jacket 2.0 Polarized Oval Sunglasses,Polished Black Frame/Black Iridium Polarized Lens\" I expected it to be.  Based on other reviews, it seems like people have been getting mixed experiences concerning the correct description of the product.  However in my experience, given the free returns policy and the fact that Amazon\\'s price (at the time) was at least $30 cheaper than at the store, I highly recommend this product even with the confusing and potentially wrong description.', 6312: 'great glasses ,I used them near water a lot,while jet-skiing and they are light,fit nice and tight,while greatly reducing glare..now I use them for driving and am extremely pleased with them', 6313: \"Typical Oakley... well made... great design.. snug fit...

I have yet to have any scratches or dings on the lenses or frames and trust me, they take quite the beating.  The socks have a great unique design which helps them from \"never\" falling off, yet you can personally replace them.  The one down side is the nose piece may be a little tight for some people, but each person varies.  Purchasing these for 80$ is one heck of a deal for a pair of oakleys.  I would definitely purchase them again!', 6321: 'Really nice glasses, they fit my small face perfectly, not like most one size fits all that make you feel like your wearing cheap 3D glasses at the movies.', 6322: 'He has had these for quite some time now.

They arrived in a sealed Oakley box, they're genuine, and they are exactly how they look in the product picture and description.  I know there had been some concern that Amazon was selling counterfeit glasses (according to another review) but the product I received was genuine Oakley, new, in the box.\", 6326: 'I love the original lens in the blue frame. They just remove enough light to not be overwhelming and still have a clear view. They are my first pair and they hug your head. I have not had them fall off and the nose piece is narrow and comfortable. I would buy another pair of them in a heartbeat. Love them.', 6327: \"The sunglasses are everything I expected plus some. This is thefirst time I have owned a pair of Oakley's. I would recommend themto my family and friends and any one else that is interested in them.\", 6328: 'This is one of my favorites accesories when I ron, because it give me a sharp view, it protects my eyes from dust and wind and it blocks the excess of light!', 6329: 'I had another pair of half jacket oakleys that were about 5 years old that I loved but the new ones seem to fit on my face more snug which I like better', 6330: \"I haven't lost them, still wearing a year later in great shape, they were shipped quick and do a great job against the sun.\", 6331: \"Really can't go wrong with Oakleys.

Maybe its because I have a large head and eyes, but I'd like to see them cover just a bit more at the bottom of my eyes.Infinite Hero - These are essentially the same as the Half Jacket 2.0, but they have the coloring and logo of the Infinite Hero program that supports returned Vets.  They cost more than the straight Half Jackets, but I don't mind because 15% of the cost is going to that program.Comfort - As noted above, I have a pretty large head - yet these glasses feel just fine.\", 6340: \"These Oakleys are authentic in package with accompanying materials, no damage and arrived on time.

They look good too!', 6349: \"After a lot of research relating to what sports-specific Oakleys I was going to purchase (there was no other brand that could compare when questioning quality), I went with the Half Jacket 2.0 model. Fast Jackets are awesome, but were not fitting in my budget. The interchangable lense option, unobtainium grips, and iridium lenses for around $90 was too convincing. I priced these at other retailers and Amazon offered the best price. This is a solid product that will last me for years. Got them in the mail on a cloudy day, didn't care, wore them anyway. Oh and I thought I was buying the regular 2.0. They ended up being the XL model, thought that was a nice bonus. If you don't go with the Half Jacket, go with Oakley. They're expensive for a reason.\", 6350: 'Very comfortable on nose and ears. Can barely tell you are wearing them aside from the reduction in light. Very lightweight for their size and they fit my large head perfectly.', 6351: 'Oakley is a great brand and have been wearing not only the sunglasses but other products for many years starting when I joined the military.

I like the fitting of it and it is cool to the eyes! This is a great buy!', 6364: 'Sunglasses are a quality product at a fair price. The same price is offered at oakley.com. However, I consider the advertising to be fraudulent. It states that two different types of lenses would be included, one for low light and one for bright light. This is why I ordered through Amazon. Lenses at Oakley are $60 extra making this sound like a great deal. The glasses came with only one set of lenses. Through live chat, an Amazon agent agreed with me and shipped another pair overnight. It came the same way, one set of lenses. This resulted in another live chat and a discount offer that will cover about a third the cost of my purchasing an extra set of lenses from Oakley which I accepted and feel I did receive a quality product at a good price. Also, the advertising will be referred to the proper department for review. Amazon is fantastic to deal with any problems you may have. Through online chat I was offered the discount or simply to return the item at no cost - simple, easy, pleasant.

I bought these to wear during flat light conditions. Wore them the day i got them and it was twice as bright with them on, as it was with them off.

When not in use, they will also hang nicely from your neck.', 6371: \"I was very skeptical of buying sunglasses that were this expensive, I had been buying cheap Walmart brand (Ironman) sunglasses for years. After breaking my fourth pair of cheap sunglasses in a year, I decided to pull the trigger.These sunglasses are great. I have had them for about 6 months, they fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable. I wear them on the top of my head when I get into a building and actually forget they are there. They are still perfectly snug that they don't fall off, I actually flipped my bike (not motorcycle) on concrete and hit the ground relatively hard and these glasses didn't budge. Fantastic sunglasses.They are also very good safety glasses, i have used them while using a dremel tool to remove some bolts. With sparks shooting directly onto them, they emerged with no damaged whatsoever and kept all of the sparks out of my eyes.I would suggest getting the polarized lenses, they cut glare very well but are more expensive.\", 6372: \"I have had these sunglasses one year and I am very happy with them.  Never got a &#34;name brand&#34; pair of sunglasses before.  I considered it a stupid waste of money.  The problem was a kept buying at least three or four pair of the fifteen to twenty dollar pairs at the store and they would last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.  I read the reviews on these and decided I would give them a try.Pros-  If you play sports, there is no frame on the bottom part of the sunglasses, therefore your view is not limited or inhibited.  Anyone who has ever lifeguarded knows this is a great feature as well...you do not lose field of vision.-  The hinges have stayed tight.  This is a big gripe I have with the cheap sunglasses you find in the store...the hinges get lose very quickly.  I've had these a year and the hinges are still tight.-  The lenses on mine have not scratched, and they should have by now with how they have gotten thrown around a bit.Cons-  There was a cover for the sunglasses, but no hard container to put them in.  For sunglasses of this expense and quality, you would think a hard container would be included.\", 6373: 'Yes Oakley sunglasses are expensive. But they are definitely worth it! With these sunglasses you can look directly at the sun and not have to squint.  These are my second pair of Oakleys.  I had the Scalpel style before but lost them :( These are a lot smaller than the Scalpels and fit on my head a bit tighter, and I have a relatively normal size head. If you have a big head get a different style. Overall I am very pleased with these sunglasses and would definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for a high quality pair of sunglasses!', 6374: 'The lenses are a little loose in the frame, but not bad for the price.

Oakley is the only brand I buy.  Hands down, they have the best sunglasses on the market.  I prefer the flak jackets over any others but I couldn't pass up the deal I got on the 2.0's.  I would recommend these sunglasses to anyone and everyone from the competitive athlete to the casual wearer.\", 6379: 'They are very comfortable to wear and are snug at the same time.  That is an issue with me because of my ginormous melon.  Most glasses are too tight on me causing discomfort if I wear them for long periods.

The polarized lenses are fabulously clear and my eyes are protected from dust. I love these sunglasses!!', 6385: 'There\\'s a misconception about the term \"XL\" here. In he original Half-jacket (1.0) Oakley released their half-jacket XLJ version, which means wider lenses while using the same sized frame. Well, these are the \"new\" XLJ, termed \"XL\". The frame size is still the same as the regular Half-jacket 2.0, just the lenses are a bit wider on the bottom corners. Either way, this sunglasses rocks. Fits like a glove, eventhough my head fits the larger-sized Oakley polarized Gascan that I bought a few years back.', 6386: 'I have had this glasses for 3 years and had no problem with them they fit good and wont fall off great buy ??????????????', 6387: 'Always have enjoyed Oakley sunglasses.

They are light, barely noticeable. They look awesome, everything is so clear absolutely no blurring on the sides. Oakley knows their stuff. I should mention I also have an older pair of Why-3 as sunglasses also Rx. My partner was given a pair of Half Jackets 2.0 (the rounder lenses) for x-mas this last season by me. So we have a few pairs. If you want something sporty that gets attention and will last you into the next century. Also the customer service is great. If you have some money left over get an Oakley watch, I have the Blade in SS and Sunburst red, my partner Crush in blue.', 6390: \"This is my first pair of Oakley's in 20+ years. I am always skeptically ordering online . I shopped local stores for months, but I couldn't justify spending the $$ on these.

Thanks Amazon for the price and quick free shipping. I would recommend these to anyone.\", 6391: 'These sunglasses are great, perfect fit and color.  Always a fan of Oakley, not to mention the price was very reasonable.', 6392: \"I'm not used to buying expensive sunglasses as I tend to break them or lose them but I was soooo tired of the cheap ones. First off the cheap ones never fit and the glass never holds in to the sunglass body. The glass usually falls out in a couple of months. These fit really nice, they look good, and they are well built. I love the fact the glass is interchangeable.\", 6393: 'I have never owned a pair of sunglasses over $20 before.  Several of my kids have Oakleys and swear by them. Decided to treat myself.  These glasses are great. Very light. I have worn them for 3 hours straight and forgot I was wearing them.

Of course I  had to buy another pair for him.  I was told to go to Amazon because they would be a little bit less expensive then going to the Oakley store.  This was true. I saved $30.00 shopping on Amazon.  I bought the rootbeer color and they look very nice.  My husband is very pleased and will be wearing them when he goes fishing.\", 6399: \"Excellent sunglasses! The frame is slim and light while also remaining quite durable. The lenses have a reddish-brown tint and are really the ideal color for clarity and sunlight protection. These are similar to the all-brown oakleys but the tinted lenses give you better glare protection. They also look great! They're very sporty and have a snug fit while also not being gigantic like costas or flimsy like Maui Jim's. You'll be satisfied!\", 6400: 'All that I can say is &#34;Great Glasses&#34;!

Very convenient while im biking its fits comfortably the polarized is really helpful', 6403: 'Probably my 4th pair of half-jackets as I keep losing them. Highly recommend them if you go in the sun a lot. Polarized is the best and worth it if you can afford them.', 6404: 'I have owned 5 pair of Oakleys starting with the original straight jackets. Would still have that pair except that replacement parts are not available and Oakley compensated me for that. I have now purchased two additional pairs of Half Jackets and decided to try the Polarized Half Jacket 2.0.  Love em.  Great upgrade.

They fit well, don't slide down your nose and look great. The polarized lenses are also great and can be replaced without buying new frames.\", 6408: \"I had the Oakley Half Jacket 1.0 but the lenses started to get the coating scratched off.  I don't know if that's a usual wear and tear as they were 6 years old... but admittedly I didn't give them too much care.I'm not the most athletic person, but I did use them for golfing all the time.  These are awesome on the course.  The polarization really cuts the glare and the XLJ/XL of these lenses frame your eyes so look left, right, up and down... the sunlight is always blocked.These aren't cheap by any means but they can take a beating and last quite a while.  For these 2.0's I got myself I'm going to take better care of them (getting a hard case instead of the stupid fabric baggie they give you).  I'm sure these will last even longer than 6 years.\", 6409: \"My husband was so happy with these. Perfect fit and the clarity is awesome.

They did, so I purchased them here. They fit well, to the point of not noticing them instantly, which is fantastic. They're super light weight and stylish. There's a tint to the lenses which will effect the way you see some colors, which was fine by me. I was just looking for something that wasn't black on black. These fit the bill all around and I'd recommend them to anyone looking to spend a couple hundred buck on protecting their eyesight. I live in AZ, so it's pretty darn important.\", 6413: '1. Great price2. Great fit and look3. Very sturdy as I wear them while playing outdoor sports4. this was my 4th pair so clearly I love em !!', 6414: \"These are my 6th pair of Oakley's over the years and they are a great fitting pair of all around active sport sunglasses. Even though they are made of plastic they still feel solid much more than the $5 pair you get from your local grocery store.  The lenses on the XL model have a little flair in them at the bottom that give you a bit more protection which make these great when playing things like sand volleyball.  The iridium is not necessary and just adds a bit of flash to them.The Pros: Solid build, durable, lens coverage, lens tint, polarized lensesThe Cons: A bit pricey for sunglasses if you don't take care of themOverall: If you are going to invest some money in a pair of sunglasses for running, biking, volleyball, etc. these are a great pair!\", 6415: \"i don't see any other brand with the combination of sex appeal and outright functionality.

And, they look badass.\", 6416: \"While these are advertised as men's glasses, I am a woman and I love them! I have had a pair before and am so glad to have another pair again.

The only draw back is the frame color options are limited.', 6418: 'These are my favorite sun glasses. They fit well. Previous version of half jacket was little small and tight for me.

Also the item ordered stated it was a \"woman\\'s\" version, but the one received was a men\\'s version. In our case, what we received was  was exactly what we wished for based on what we found in stores prior to the purchase, however the 20% deal on Amazon was unbeatable by any of the outlets we shopped in.We think the model that arrived is the current one, but the write up on Amazon is still of the older verion. We strongly recommend checking them out in the store and making sure you get the exact model name as there are many that look  almost similar, yet different in fit and properties.As for the glasses themselves - we find them very comfortable to wear, stable thanks to the rubber on the handles and the nose piece, durable (especially the Flak Jacket where hinges are internalized so they can\\'t break), and very cool looking. An added benefit is that you can replace lenses alone if the coating is scratched, instead of being forced to buy a new costly pair as is the case with Maui Jims.Excellent product - great price and lightning fast delivery: Amazon at its best!', 6420: 'Since I have written Oakely reviews before I will be brief on this one...

I use them for cycling and mountain biking, the only problem is that they tend to get foggy when you stop moving. I know these glasses werent intended for cycling, but the jawbone and splitjacket are too pricy.', 6439: 'Quality product with fair price', 6440: \"I needed nice, stylish everyday shades for this Summer and I couldn't be happier with these Oakleys! I wear them everywhere. I strongly recommend these shades, you will not be disappointed!\", 6441: \"LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!!! I didnt know what to expect as far as sizing because most oakley's that are styled like this are wide, but these werent, they fit perfect!! The lens color has a slight redish tint which is nice, and theyre super lightweight!\", 6442: \"These glasses are very cool. I think the only problem is how the Oakley symbol part protrudes out when the glasses are closed, making it so that you can't hang them from the neck of your shirt or anything like that (which I liked to do with my old glasses).\", 6443: \"Bought these for the hubs. They are the only glasses he'll wear, in fact this is his 4th pair. haha\", 6444: \"First pair of Oakleys I've bought in 20 yrs.  Always out of my price range. However I found an amazing deal on Amazon as always. Received these in 2 days as advertised. These are the perfect size for my face.  They are a very clear visual  I'm now an Oakley man once again. Highly recommend.\", 6445: 'Was a little nervous about buying online because i was not sure it would fit but it fits my big head perfectly. exactly as described.

Very nice design.', 6447: 'My 1st pair of oakleys and i love it!!!

These fit me as expected, I wouldn't go with any other brand Thanks Amazon!!\", 6451: 'The fit was great, love the color lenses. Am really happy with this purchase. Great for used when driving in winter.', 6452: 'I bought these glasses for my upcoming golf vacation in Florida. I have used them several times while out for walks in the snow here and they worked just fine. They have a comfortable, snug fit and do not darken the scenery much. I think they will be great on the golf course on sunny days.', 6453: \"What first caught my eye was how vibrant the violet colored lenses looked. I initially bought these because they looked great, but when I got outside the lenses felt great on my eyes and gave me no eye strain like the cheaper glasses I've bought lately. When you see those cheap sunglasses in malls you think it's a good deal, but I often question whether it truly is adequately UV/UA protected. My eyes always felt strained after using them. You do save a lot of money on the cheap ones, but your eyes will thank you with these quality lenses.\", 6454: 'Good glasses good price.', 6455: 'These shades are cool.  They arrived quick and in new condition.  They are some super light shades and the lenses are sweet!', 6456: \"I love them they look good fit good and sexy but I don't know y they are a little uncomfortable on my ears but there sexy\", 6457: \"As with most Oakley products, these glasses are quality. The only downside is they cut out a bit of your peripheral vision. It took a little getting used to while riding my motorcycle. I had to make an effort to turn my head more than usual. If you are buying these to ride in, you may want to get something that's more wrap around. That's why I only gave it 4 stars.\", 6458: 'As a long time Oakley customer I had never purchased them online. These are my favorite glasses ever. They look and feel great. I get tons of compliments', 6459: \"This is my third pair of Oakley's. I have loved every pair i owned. They are very lightweight and fit very well. (It is hard for me to find properly fitting sunglasses because I have a large head.) i also think that this pair (Black/purple)is sweet because depending on the angle you look out you can see either a purple or blue tint.The only negative about these glasses is when driving i see purple glare. I would not recommend them for driving sunglasses if you drive a lot. However they look great and work well if your going to the beach or any other outdoor hangout spots.\", 6460: \"I love these sunglasses. They are my third pair of Oakleys-I've always had a positive impression. I have a large, but narrow head and they fit me well. I did get a small knick on the lens but it was from dropping on a rock :( My fault!\", 6461: 'Awesome glasses, would buy more. I wanted a pair that people could not see where my eyes are and these work great.', 6462: 'This is my first Oakley sunglass,I am very satisfied with it.

Thats how I knew this glasses would fit me.', 6465: \"Over the many year I have owned numerous pairs of Oakley's. My Straight Jackets had nothing wrong with them, but when Oakley released the Crankcase I just had to have them. Ordered direct from Oakley and received them today. Still top notch polarized lenses. The Crankcase is very light and feels well put together. They fit my face perfectly, very comfortable. Well worth the $160 price tag for the polarized version. I got the Polished black / Matt Black version, which I might add is a nice touch and contrasts very well.\", 6466: 'It is definitely what I was expecting, an authenticated oakley product , have it registered with a full year warranty, great...', 6467: \"These are great sunglasses. This is my second pair. I lost my first pair while surfing in OBX. Someone found a nice shell! Jumped on Amzon.com and had a new pair delivered to the beach house. They have a good secure and comfortable fit. The only downside I have found is they stream up if your really sweating and there is no breeze.  For that same reason they are great for the boat as they deflect the wind well. A few more polarized color options would be nice, but for Oakley polarized at this price, these can't be beat!\", 6468: 'The Oakley sunglasses are the best glasses I ever worn.i wear them day to day plus wear them on motorcycle which are great. I would recommend to anyone.', 6469: 'Service was great as usual with Amazon team. My only draw back is the mirror shade. Not a big fan of that look as no one can see my eyes, so I fun myself taking off the glasses to avoid being em rude.

I love these things.  They are very comfortable.  The square lenses are fantastic blocking the sun at the edges.', 6472: 'Oakley lenses are the best!

Extremely affordable,Very well made comfortable and stylish.. Would recommend to a friend', 6476: 'Amigos mios, quede sorprendido con este nuevo modelo..... Una vez mas, oakley acieta en un modelo liviano,y resistente. En mi caso es el 4to. par que logro comprar y todos de la misma marca.Gran claridad de vision, Excelente producto', 6477: 'The Crankcase is a newer plastic(O matter)-frame pair that is very similar in design to the Gascan, Fuelcell, and Fives Squared. All of these models belong to Oakley\\'s Lifestyle collection, which appears to comprise the company\\'s less-expensive offerings. Even so, Oakley doesn\\'t offer a cheap pair of sunglasses, as the same handful of materials (especially the \"Plutonite\" lenses) are generally used throughout, regardless of product line. The aforementioned models of the Lifestyle Collection fall at the lower end of the Oakley price range simply due to their featureless \"O-Matter\"/plastic frames. By featureless, I mean that they contain no areas of \"unobtanium\" rubber for grip. The positive side of that is that there\\'s nothing on them to wear out except for the hinges (which contain no metal prone to rust).  Despite the lack of frame features, the lenses are in fact the same quality you\\'d find in any of the more-expensive models. The way I see it, when you buy Oakleys, you\\'re basically paying for the lenses, so the plastic frames don\\'t bother me much considering you can get them at a much lower price. After extensive online and in-store research of Oakley\\'s bloated catalogue, I narrowed it down to three plastic framed pairs - Gascan, Fives Squared, and Crankcase - ultimately settling on the latter.It is worth mentioning that the Crankcase, Gascan, and Fuelcell are all very similar, but the small differences do matter. The Fuelcell has the largest lenses of the bunch (slightly)and has curved temples that wrap around the head. The Gascan has the shortest lenses top to bottom, while the temples are straighter and wrap less. The Crankcase is almost a hybrid of the two - closer in style to the Fuelcell, but closer in size to the Gascan. It has lenses very similar in shape to the Fuelcell\\'s albeit smaller in dimension. The Crankcase lenses are actually narrower than the Gascan lenses by about 4mm (and the frame may be narrower overall), though these two pairs share the same 17mm nosebridge. The Crankcase, like the Fuelcell, also has temples with more curve. That was a feature I didn\\'t know I wanted until I tried these all on at the Oakley store (ya gotta try them on if you can). I was initially going to go with the smaller-lense Fives Squared, but frame just didn\\'t stay on my head that well, and felt like it was going to fall off too easily. Perhaps the temples were too short and didn\\'t go far enough behind my head. All the other pairs stayed on my head better, including the straight-templed Gascan. Some people with larger heads have complained of too much pressure with the Gascan temples, but my small head (size 7) didn\\'t mind them at all.Even so, I found the Crankcase striking the best balance between size, fit, style, and ultimately price. At the Oakley store the pair I wanted (matte black/violet iridium) would have set me back nearly 120$, but then I found it here on Amazon for less than 70$. I wanted a matte black frame, and saw the Gascan only came with plain gray lenses in that frame color unless you went up in price for Black Iridium polarized lenses. I figured the violet iridium lense of the Crankcase was a more interesting color choice for about the same cost. From the outside, they appear as a mirrored purple, but looking out through them one sees a greenish tint. Oakley currently lists this lense tint as having a protection rating of only 1, but after emailing them, they confirmed that it is actually a 3; this makes more sense given its relatively dark tint. Overall, I\\'m very happy with the Crankcase in general and I feel it was a good choice. If you\\'ve been looking into the Gascan and/or Fuelcell (I\\'ve been seeing more of these styles lately), consider the Crankcase, but definitely try them all on before you make your decision. Even though none of these are super expensive by Oakley standards, a pair of nice sunglasses is still something of a small investment, and you\\'ll be wearing them a lot.', 6478: 'I bought these as a fathersday present for my dad and the look on his face was enough forn5 stars! My dad wears them all the time and he loves them.', 6479: 'I like these glasses.  I have a smaller head size 7 hat.  These fit me perfectly.  I had tried them on in another store before ordering.', 6480: \"I LOVE THESE OAKLEY'S. THIS WILL BE MY FIFTH PAIR.  IM THINKING I WANT ANOTHER PAIR. STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES I WANT.\", 6481: \"It's a very good product, with these polarized lens i can look till the sun!! Ow i'm kidding , but it's is very good, i like everything on this sunglasses design and lens!!\", 6482: 'Great fit for my husband yet he knew what he wanted he has other Oakley shades came at a reasonable time', 6483: 'My husband loves his sunglasses! A Christmas gift. He even takes care of them!!!', 6484: \"Really nice item! Registred on Oakley with serial number and noticed as real Oakley's!! Great purchase :) Logo seems white but is chrome.\", 6485: \"This is my second pair of Oakley's and I must say these are by far my favorite. I picked them up as prescription sun glasses from my optometrist. They are a larger frame, which I do like because I have a big head. The fit is nice and I like the larger lenses. They have an opening on the side that is great because the frame doesn't fully obstruct your peripheral view. I like the style of the polished black mixed with the matte black. As usual Oakley's are great because you can interchange the lenses if you happen to scratch them. You just pop the lenses out and put in new ones.  I would recommend this pair sunglass to anyone who is looking.\", 6486: \"These are very stylish.  From a style standpoint, they look sort of like sleeker versions of the gascans.  If you like that look but don't like how huge and &#34;look at me!&#34; the gascans can be, this will probably be a good alternative for you.I love that they cover and encapsulate your whole eye.  I don't like when glasses have small lenses/frames that leave you with the edges of your vision seeing normal bright light.  From a vision standpoint, these feel almost like goggles in that the tinting covers your entire field of vision.My only real complaint is that they're not as comfortable as some sport sunglasses to me.  They're made of hard, thick plastic and after wearing them for a little while I can feel the pressure behind my ears.  Also, my eyelashes just do brush up against them sometimes, there is not a lot of distance between the lens and your eye if you have long lashes.  They're not nearly as comfortable as something like the half jacket, but the tradeoff is that they allow MUCH less light leakage and they are (imo) more stylish.Another small complaint is that the holes on the side of the frame (put there for style) sometimes let some light in if the sun is low and directly to your side.  I wish they would have just used a lighter or different colored plastic there instead of leaving it open.In the end, I'm keeping these in spite of some minor discomfort because I just look too dang awesome when wearing them.\", 6487: 'Originaly had gascan model which I liked but always felt they were to wide for my face. After losing that pair I settled on the crankcase to replace them. I was very satisfied with the fact they are a sleeker, narrower fit. Plus the fact I got them for the same price with the polarized lenses makes it a 5 star rating.', 6488: 'I love the way they look, i tried these on the store but the price tag on was above 340USD. I look for them in Amazon and I saw that the price was 220, still high but i was willing to pay for the quality and Oakley brand. I love how easy is to change de lenses, the little straps that avoids dropping my sunglasses and the way they look on me.BUT... I have been having an issue with them, when i go out for a morning ride on my MTB, the weather is a bit cold outside and theses sunglasses tend to fog. I tried cleaning them with special Oakley products but they still fog on me.The only thing i have been able to do, it is to wear my TIFOSI sunglasses when it is too cold outside, and save my awesome Oakley for warmer days.', 6489: 'There is no better than Oakley on Eyewear, prescription or sports..this are no exception..great feeling and good air flow inside, also lenses have a nice diference so you can use it on clowdy days and very sunny aswell', 6490: \"I love them!!!

It is some serious investment but worth every cent. The clarity is simply amazing and second to none. The fit is perfect doesnt fall off when you are running.

I sweat a lot and everytime I fog the lenses on my old glasses. That' s very bad. It still happens on this oakley (but only when I stop to walk). The only thing I must do to solve the problem is put my bicycle on move and.... the the fog on the lenses is gone, quickly.The frame is weightless and don't give us headaches...

They don't move around when I'm running, unlike other high end glasses. I have owned Nike models and these are far more comfortable and offer much more protection from light.The extra lens is great for low light situations, i use them for my morning runs and when i go out in the afternoon. Not only do they look futuristic and awesome but they truly offer the clarity and quality that Oakley stands for.When changing the lenses you do have to touch them a lot and you may leave a lot of smudges and finger prints but other than that changing the lenses is very easy. It comes with a great case that stores the glasses and the extra lens along with a pouch that serves as a cleaning cloth.Over all great product, great quality and its worth the money.\", 6515: \"Fits nicely and great for running! Item was nicely packed and i-Parcel delivery wasn't as bad as some others have experienced... so VERY pleased.\", 6516: 'These are great sports glasses. I use them to bike and they are excellent.

The frame is so lightweight I can wear it all day long. The price is a bit steep. But with the current promotion that Amazon is running right now, every one should grab one. Highly recommend it.\", 6520: 'as expected these are great', 6521: 'One of the nicest looking frame.

The quality of the glasses are great and the combination of the silver frame with blue lens(the blue is actually darker than what is pictured) is a nice look. If you're funny about just wanting to wear sunglasses without a hat I would recommend the flak jacket frame by Oakley\", 6527: \"I found this was the cheapest Radar Lock in Amazon and it came with 2 lenses and a super large protective case. No defect with the product. Both lenses works wonderful and they are super clear especially the persimmon one. But I use both depending on the sky and weather. The view when I'm on my road bike is fantastic. Light and no problem with the eye level on drop bar. As Asian, I dont find a problem with fitting as well. The nose piece is just nice for me. Another piece is smaller and I don't use that one. Switching lenses are easy but most of the time I use the darker grey lense.This grey/black color is actually nice as it is not too catchy. It blend in with my silver/grey helmet and my black  roadbike.The packages arrived a week after the expected delivery dates. I guess it was due to the Xmas holidays.\", 6528: \"Got a great deal for this item.I knew what I was purchasing as I have pondered getting for a MUCH higher price from other sellers before. The only thing that I was slightly unsure about were the actual colour/sheen of the iridium lenses. Its difficult to simply identify them from these pictures, and its also due to the sheer amount of lenses that Oakley puts out. But I'm not particular and they turned out fine anyway. Product came as advertised without scratches or flaws as far as I can see. Tried them on and they seem to work and fit just fine. No unpleasant surprises at all.I'm very satisfied with this purchase!\", 6529: \"Considering the price comparison here it's worth it.  Design n amazon service was excellent.  Only thing is you can't hold the object. Didn't expected it to be that light.  But overall satisfied.\", 6530: \"They do not change to a darker color in Sun Light. They protect your Eyes from UV light but not from Glare. Just so you know.I ride my bike with them in the evening or cloudy days and they are great but not good in direct Sun Light. I ended up buying another pair of Radar Paths in Black and they were too dark in the morning or evening.What I did is end up buying a replacement lens from Oakley that transition.The Bottom line is that I spent a ton of money on two pairs of Oakley's and another lens. So be careful of what you wish for or you will end up buying two pairs of Oakley's and maybe another lens???\", 6531: \"When I first saw this at a store the price was $500.00 it comes with 4 extra frame and 4 lenses which I don't really need I just wanted to buy this one in particular but they won't allow me cause it comes in a bundle.

Prescription inserts work well.\", 6536: 'The product is good... the only point is that it takes some minutes from the complete change from clear to black, but it does a good job dealing with luminosity changes.I practice adventure race and this product is very adequate for this usage. As there is lots of changes between dark single tracks in the jungle with open air field cycling, this is the adequate product to avoid changing or having to take off glasses.It would be great if the product comes with extra lenses, one that had more contrast, as it is pretty simple to change lenses with the LOCK system.', 6537: 'excellent, very good quality, perfect fit and very light the best is the design,ventilation glasses are great I recommend it!', 6538: \"I did actually order the Path model but received the Pitch instead.

The clarity is amazing and the lenses change out easily. I'm glad I finally broke down and spent the money. I'll never go back to gas station sunglasses!\", 6541: 'these Oakleys are the best baseball sunglasses you can change the lens quickly for when the sun starts going down and the price was great - they even give you the extra lens! love them', 6542: \"Bought for cycling. Very comfortable, forget I'm wearing them. They stay put & don't slip about. Lenses easy to change & they look great.\", 6543: 'I often tell my cycling friends: \"Oakley are just expensive plastics, but they are so good that I am willing to pay for it.\"  These Radarlocks are sturdy and the lenses are just superlative.  I have the positive red as my main lens.  They are so good that you forget you actually have the lens in front of your eyes.  I also have the VR30 and the yellow lens.  They are expensive so jump on them if you come across a bargain.  You won\\'t regret it.', 6544: 'They are exactly what you would expect from Oakley!  Awesome!  Fit great - and make everything look sooo clear!  Great buy!', 6545: \"After a long battle with inferior sunglasses, mainly because I was being cheap for so long and I didn't want to spend anymore than $20 on a pair of sunglasses, I finally reached my last straw.The features I was looking for in Sunglasses were a pair that were very durable; scratch, sweat, and water resistant; secure fit to my head, no slippage on my nose bridge; white frame color (to dampen sun absorption). These were perfect and more.What I really enjoy about this pair of glasses is the ability to swap out lenses from the frame, which is why these are called 'lock' glasses. They unlock from the front plant to allow you to remove the lenses. When you purchase the sunglasses, Oakley provides you with two pairs, one shaded, and one yellow tinted lenses which is used primarily for foggy days in order to brighten the surroundings. The yellow tinted lenses really does help.Everything is very durable, and it happens to fit me very well. I really can't complain so far. I've gone on distance runs already and ran a half marathon with these. I've splashed water and Gatorade all over myself and probably these sunglasses and the liquids just roll off.When wearing these sunglasses there is just a confidence factor that you get because you just feel cool! Aside from the cache of it being a pair of Oakley's. Overall, I've been very satisfied with my purchase, and I expect to be wearing these sunglasses for most likely the next 5 years or longer, assuming they hold up.\", 6546: \"The glasses are awesome and exactly what you expect when you buy an Oakley product. Trying to figure out which lens took some research but in the area I'm living and using the sunglasses.......they are perfect. Stay in place and enough air passes thru that they don't fog...\", 6547: \"I finally found a pair of glasses that sit on my nose instead of my cheeks.  Asian-fit sunglasses are a godsend.  Thanks for the quick shipping.  Can't wait to try other styles and colors.\", 6548: \"The other review I read on here said that they felt flimsy...interestingly enough, the lightweight feel of these glasses are what sold me!  They are so comfortable that I can't tell they're on..except for the fact that the awesome bronze lens makes everything outside look amazing!  The greens are greener, the sky is so blue, it's great..to top it off, looking at the ocean with that polarized lens makes you feel like you're in the Caribbean!  I had previously sworn off Oakley bc I didn't like the fact that their polarized aspect of the lens is more of a coating/film vs Maui Jims that are a glass polarized lens all the way thru...but these felt so good on, looked so stylish, and made everything look so good- I figured I'd give them a second chance.  Maui Jims are more pricey: but you are paying to have a much longer lasting warranty and better lenses...but for less money, these are so great- it just depends on what you want to spend.  They don't feel cheap to me...they feel light on my face (no marks on my nose and ears) and non-obtrusive, but I don't feel like I could just break them easily...Also, the nose part is RUBBER (not the adjustable kind but an extension of the plastic frame)!  Most importantly in terms of the lens issue: always try to keep them in the case when off bc that's how the polarized layer starts to scratch off eventually.  Mind you, Oakley is great about honoring a 1 year warranty and you send them in with your receipt (Amazon is an Authorized dealer) and they will replace lenses, etc if needed. I gave four stars bc a longer lasting/more durable lens would be ideal.\", 6549: 'I bought these as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves them and they fit her perfectly. Thanks for the quick and timely delivery', 6550: 'I liked so much, the item arrived at time, the sunglasses are not completly polished so check it before and the lens are a little big for small faces.', 6551: 'Oakley Scalpel Black Iridium replacement lensesI purchased this replacement lenses directly from Amazon, but upon opening the package, I noticed the lenses were wrapped in a foam pouch. The foam is similar to the plastic foam used for electronic devices. I had purchased Oakley replacement lenses from Oakley directly in the past for my Flak Jackets (VR28 XLJ lenses) and they came wrapped in a mini-version of the Oakley microfiber bag, but designed for lenses with a partition to prevent scratches.While the foam pouch that came with the Scalpel lenses had a partition as well, whoever shipped/packed the lenses opted to just throw BOTH lenses into the same area, allowing the lenses to rub against one another during the entire transit. The result was a noticeable scratch in one of the lenses right out of the box.I\\'d inspect the lenses carefully to ensure they are shipped/packed properly. The good news is that these lenses fit my Scalpel perfectly. The removal/installation procedure is quite easy as all that is required is flexing of the frame encircling the lenses. Essentially, you are \"enlarging\" the opening to push the old lenses out towards the front (away from face) and then snapping in the new lenses back into place. The black Iridium replacement lenses fit my Scalpel a lot better than the original Fire Iridium lenses.Oakley has a wide variety of lens choices, but I found the only ones worthwhile are Black Iridium, VR28, and VR28 Black Iridium. The G30 is great for golf, but it allows much more light than VR28 or VR28 Black Iridium which makes it useful only in specific conditions. I found that VR28 can still glare badly. VR28 Black Iridium is a happy medium that gives you great contrast without affecting color perception, and the Iridium coating \"hides\" your eyes a bit more. Black Iridium is my choice for really bright conditions or where I just want a gray neutral tone. I don\\'t like polarized lenses because they make things look odd. Fire Iridium was mostly green in color and it made things look very off during the summer. Every person will perceive things differently, but my recommendations for Oakley lenses are Black iridium and VR28 Black Iridium.Overall: 4/5 stars - fits great, looks great, but Oakley did not ship/pack these lenses properly and I had to return them.', 6552: 'Love these. I debated getting them, but so happy I did. They fit perfect, are super comfortable to wear, and fun style. I wear them all the time.', 6553: \"These glasses.....I have dropped them, stepped on them, sat on them....totally abused them so many times! hahaha and other than a few scratches on the lenses they still look great and protect my eyes. I'm sure I'll have and use them for many more years.\", 6554: 'Purchased these some months back and I really appreciate the two cases one soft one hard.  The lenses are light color but provide great protection for my sensitive blue eyes.  I use these everyday and they are comfortable and would easily purchase Oakleys again.', 6555: 'I have no complaints whatsoever with the product. It feels good and does the job of reducing brightness. My major complaint is the description - black iridium. Maybe I dont understand what iridium really stands for but the lens is not black. Its brown, more like sepia. I expected dark black-grey (isn\\'t that what \"black\" means?). This is brighter than my original lens. I kept it on cuz its great for shooting!', 6556: \"I bought this bag for my stepdaughter, who is a junior in high school, and it is so durable. She carries so many books in this thing and the stitching is incredibly strong. The zippers are heavy-duty and the straps are very comfortable she says. The chest strap is great for taking strain off her back. She also loves the design. I wish I would have bought this for her sooner instead of going through two bags already this school year (as I write this it is January and she has gone through two bags in four months). It is a larger sized bag so I wouldn't suggest purchasing it for a child younger than late middle school.\", 6557: 'For the most part, I really like this backpack.  I was really excited to find out that is is waterproof!  However, I was disappointed at how wide the shoulder straps are. They keep falling down!', 6558: \"I did a bit of research before hand trying to find a good sized bag I could keep organized and have a comfortable fit.This bag does just that for me.The colors are very vibrant and cause me to get a lot of compliments on this back pack. It's a very cool looking bag.The zippers are very nice and the second compartment zipper is hidden under some material so it might get annoying when you have to unzip it over and over then have to move it each time.The whole bag is divided very nicely to keep my different notebooks and books organized.The straps are very comfortable and the bag itself is very padded on the back so nothing is digging into my shoulders or hitting my back if I run around with books in it.Sadly I do not give it five stars because it ALMOST fits my HP pavilion DV7 laptop but does not cover it entirely...almost though. I figured I wouldn't have any luck but it did suggest it could fit 17in laptops.I suggest buying this if you like lot's of space and something colorful with an edge! :D\", 6559: 'When my son picked out this backpack I just shook my head (would not have been my first choice). It arrived fast and is very well built. The picture does not do it justice it is really a good looking bag. (who knew). I liked it so much I bought my other son one of a different color.', 6560: 'I bought this for my 15 year old daughter.  It is big enough for all her high school books, folders and everything else.

The only thing is that the first bag was more bigger,\", 6563: \"My high school son asked for this book bag at the beginning of the school year.  He's very meticulous about having all of his things right where he needs them when he needs them, etc., a place for everything.  This bag met that criteria.  Also, he carries ALL his books to and from school every day, and that bag is packed completely full and so heavy, I can hardly pick it up myself -- and I work out regularly!  It has held up extremely well under that kind of constant wear and tear.  Very well made and nice-looking book bag.\", 6564: \"This is an updated review:  after packing for a trip i am really surprised on how big this backpack is.  Originally I said it was smaller than I thought.  It wasn't until I started to pack I realize the size of this thing.  I am able to fit 5 days worth of clothes a laptop and more in it.  There are tons of pockets.  I was a little worried when they said it would fit my 13 in macbook because I have a case around it.  With the backpack being new I had to push it in just a little but it fits like a glove.  Would recommend this product for anybody that is looking for a well made, nice looking backpack.\", 6565: 'The backpack is just what I expected, very good materials and space is quite large despite what you see. It is very aesthetic, comfortable and easy to wear. The compartment for sunglasses is ideal. I recommend this product to everyone and especially in brighter colors.', 6566: 'I love this backpack. It is lightweight, yet holds up to a lot of weight being put in it. I have not babied this bag and it has stood strong.', 6567: 'Got this for my 13 year old daughter for school. Has plenty of room for all of her stuff. Seems very well made.', 6568: \"If I had tried these on in a store first, I'm not sure I would have bought them: they are of a very unique shape that I'm still getting used to and am ambivalent about how they look on MY face, though I have gotten some positive feedback from friends about them.  Kind of wish Oakley had a feature on their website that would allow you to upload your photo and have various lense styles superimposed on your face and then rotate 360 degrees, this would greatly simplify online shopping.The lenses are beautifully sharp however, as one would expect from polarized material.  Since I bought them mainly for use while driving (when I want the maximum visual sharpness), I am pretty satisfied with them.The glasses are fairly comfortable, I like the nose pads.These are my second pair of Oakleys---I have a lightweight wraparound pair that I use for running and biking.  I bought these for half off MSRP at the Oakley Vault discount site, which is another reason why I'm not really complaining about them.\", 6569: \"These are the real thing.

PERFECT BAG AND BEST ONE IVE EVER HAD HANDS DOWN!!!!\", 6585: 'I purchase this backpack after my previous Oakley\\'s back strap failing after only 9 months. Being top of the line, I expect this backpack to be stronger, but only time will tell me. This backpack is overkill for school, and probably weigh more than you expect for the purpose, but I wanted a big back that I can throw everything in it when needed since I bike to school (3 books, binder, laptop, sweatshirts, minor things and maybe I bought something that day) and still use the same backpack for other purposes, like travelling.Those who complain about weight and size, just picked a wrong backpack for their purpose and should only blame themselves, not Oakley\\'s designer team. My old $25 compact backpack with two small compartments are almost weightless and comfortable when carrying just a few things, but with no cushion/compartment for laptop, a tumbler inside main compartment, no extra room if I want to carry unexpected items, it does not work for me. This backpack was a right choice for me, but it will not work for your specific purposes. You should\\'t even CONSIDER this backpack if you need a light/small/easy to access backpack. This backpack isn\\'t just simply designed for that purpose.Pros- Visual: The reason I decided to drop $170 for it in first place.- Glasses compartment: Conveniently located with protection, so now I actually carry my sunglasses all the time. I didn\\'t bother bringing around my sunglasses before for daily life due to bulkiness and weight of the case.- Large side pockets: Two side pockets are very large and can be used to put many stuffs. My previous backpacks\\' side pockets were rather small and you can only put a certain things in there, but these side pockets are huge and my big Starbucks tumbler goes in their easily.- Protection for gadgets: Hard walled accessory pocket in front compartment.- Side access to laptop compartment: Easy and quick access to laptop, or if you don\\'t use one, you can use this space for whatever your main thing is as the space is huge.- Bottom \"Shoes\" compartment: First time having a such compartment, but I can see it becoming useful when I don\\'t want to mix something with other goodies. It also has a strap around the zipper so it won\\'t open unintentionally.Cons- Access to main compartment: The metal clips are understandable as they play their role in the design, but my complain comes from top glasses compartment not staying open unless you hold it up. Or you need to flip it back fully, which causes bending of the top part itself. I am worried that it will cause deformity overtime if I continue to flip it completely backwards.- Access to front compartment: You have to unclip in order to access the small front compartment for gadgets. So if you want to bring out a pen, you have to unclip twice, unzip, pull the cover up and pull out the pen and close it in reverse step. You pretty much have to put down your backpack most of the time to pull things out.', 6586: 'This backpack has earned its name for sure.  The quality is amazing and this thing just looks like a tank.  already getting some comments about how sturdy it looks.  Really good storage space and for someone like me who carries around my Windows 8 Tablet and laptop it has more than enough room for all my accessories, cables and such.  I am super happy with this purchase.  I travel a lot and this allows me on overnight trips to fit everything I need into one bag along with all my computing stuff.', 6587: 'I love this backpack. I have been looking everywhere for a laptop bag that fits my 17\" ASUS comfortably, and still have room for everything else. This did the trick, and it looks frickin awesome! +1 for not looking like a geeky laptop bag XD.

Don\\'t have anything bad to say about this at all!', 6588: 'Im in the military and work on the flightline. I needed a sturdy back pack because i will be using it everyday. It is definatly that, ive abused this backpack alot and its been out in the weather alot. It still looks great and i still get people asking me where i bought it. I would buy this again.', 6589: \"The first time I saw this bag I had to have it, unfortunately the steep price tag held me back from purchasing it. I'm a bit thrifty when it comes to spending my money. I special opportunity arose where I had a chance to get this bag at a discounted rate through work, and jumped on it.I carry a laptop every day so I've gone through bags like crazy, they don't normally hold up to the day to day abuse. I've had this bag for about 7 months now, and it still looks brand new. I hope it lasts as long as I think it will. It's a large bag, I've packed it pretty full on a few different occasions, and have always had plenty of room to spare. The extra shoe compartment is nice, don't have to worry about getting your electronics, or clothes dirty. It has other large compartments and places to hold/protect your Oakley glasses and cell phones. I've found that the glasses pocket holds my Motorola bluetooth headset perfectly around my glasses. The straps on the side work awesome for holding montster/rockstar cans snugly. I get compliments on how cool this bag is all of the time.If I wanted to nitpick this bag, there are a couple of things I would like to see differently. I wish the top opening was a little larger. Even with this huge bag, I can't get my hard inner shelled lunch box inside. There is plenty of room inside for it, but the opening is just a tab to small for it to fix. Not a huge deal, I just use a soft lunch bag when I take the motorcycle. The other thing I'd like to see is a netted zipper area somewhere to keep change or whatever in there. Again, not a huge deal but sometime nice to have on some of the other bags I've owned.All in all, I love this bag. If it lasts a long time, I will definitely pay full price if I ever need to purchase another.\", 6590: 'This backpack is HUGE.

It has the following features-An internal padding that functions perfectly to protect your 19-inch laptop, textbooks and paper!-It has another internal compartment that will hold your common portable electronics (iPod, camera, handheld video camera) + It also has three slots to hold your writing utensils.- On the top flap of the backpack there is a hardened pouch that you can put an iPod in, and then string the headphones through a very small opening so you can listen to your pond without holds it in your hand or pocket!-There is a poach on each side of the backpack that will hold a Nivea body wash bottle or a bottle of Ethos Water.- On the bottom of the backpack there is a modular pouch that has a small opening with a mesh like filter.  This is PERFECT for putting your wet swim trunks and flip-flops so you don\\'t have to get your other work out gear wet!- The backpack has form fitted padding with modular shoulder straps + a light strap that can go across your chest for extra protection.-My personal favorite feature about this backpack is the three metal \"loops\" on the backpack.  These loops are securely stitched to the backpack.  I will tie my gym shoes to the loops so that I do not have to carry them in my hands.All in all, this is a high quality backpack that will last you years with even with a large amount of abuse and tossing around.

Its Red, so I know its mine  (but comes in other colors).  It has a lumbar articualted and padded support for the back, a quick laptop access zipper and it is expandable so I can hold even more stuff. I like the rugged construction and the external straps and cleats for hanging water bottles, carabiners, and such.  After using this for 2 weeks now, I can tell you with some sureity I will use this pack for years to come.This pack is a MUST!! for a remote business person who needs to keep their stuff with them at all times.Oakley has hit the mark!

M18x owners, sorry, but you\\'ll have to look elsewhere.If you\\'re looking for an alternative to the Alienware Orion messenger bag to save yourself the shoulder pain, this bag is it. One can practically live out of this bag since they can put so much stuff in it. There\\'s pockets and compartments for everything. What this bag can do that the Orion messenger cannot, is have plenty of spare room to also fit my laptop fan dock, a Cooler Master U3.On top of that, it looks very cool, and the weight when fully loaded is fairly balanced on your back.The only con I can think of, is that this bag is not geared to be as checkpoint-friendly as, lets say, an Alienware Orion messenger bag.Another thing to keep in mind, is that there are imitators out there making similar but poor quality duplicates of this bag. Beware.Search \"Oakley Kitchen Sink Backpack Mochila (Fake and Real)\" on Youtube and you will see the differences.

This bag is a typical Oakley product. Great quality, cool looking, and very comfortable to wear on your back. I really like the bottom floor pocket that is waterproof for separating wet clothes after a day at the beach or separate dirty laundry from clean stuff, I really, really like this bag. So why not 5 stars?... I've had the bag for a few months now and I find that there are a couple of reasons why I do not use it all the time as my main backpack:1st: It is loud, too loud! What do I mean? The bag calls a lot of attention, which is cool, but it can also make you stand out too much, or make you look like the guy that's showing off his new backpack, or have others make stupid comments about the excessive amount of &#34;flair&#34;, most people would say: &#34;who cares what others think!&#34;, well, this can lead to potentially unsafe or weird situation, if you travel to shady places where you may get mugged, or where you are trying to &#34;blend-in&#34;, then this bag is not a good option. It looks and it is very expensive, therefore making you look like a rich kid who has vey expensive toys in your bag and worth a mugging or a snatch.2nd: I can't stand the metal rings/hooks on the outside of the bottom pocket! I wish you could take them off! I've had people get caught up with them when in tight places like an elevator or the subway, I've had complete strangers pull me by these rings in a joking matter, and they really show no purpose other than to be an attention magnet. I don't see how anyone would use these for hooking-up stuff unless you were climbing, and even that would not be practical, and even unsafe as having something hooked up to these can take the balance off your body if it gets caught up on something.Don't let these two things discourage you from checking out the bag, but do think about it if you are not looking for something that may call too much attention to you. I think that the quality is very nice and durable, better than most other Oakley backpacks, but it also comes at a hefty cost.Overall I do think it is worth the $175+ I paid for it, because it's high quality, versatility, and style. I wish it would be more modify-able to let you take off the hooks and flair that make it so loud.\", 6602: 'I\\'ve been a fan of Oakley bags for a long time before I bought the Kitchen Sink. The first impression after unpacking is that it\\'s heavy, and it sure is. All the metal adds to the weight, but it does give a wicked look to the bag. I mainly use this bag for everything, and this is my weapon of choice during travelling. I\\'ve had this bag for about 2 years now and have flown around the world at least thrice with this on my back. Although heavy, this bag is extremely comfortable on the shoulders courtesy the padding and a little height adjustment. I have actually timed myself while carrying a full bag on my shoulders for about 3 hours plus before I became exhausted, but the shoulders were still good.  The waist straps are full metal, which I simply tucked them away since I don\\'t use them.As for the space, let me give an example of my travel situation. I prefer to carry all my belongings in hand baggage to whatever extent. So the Kitchen Sink holds 2 laptops - 14\\'\\' + 15\\'\\' (in the laptop compartment), my bag of adapters, chargers, hard drives, cables (in one side pocket), my hair trimmer, electronic shaver and toiletries (in the other side pocket), my 160GB iPod Classic (perfect fit in the front padded pocket slot), a toothbrush, house + car keys (+ other small things in the front pocket), my passport, eye mask, headphones, glasses, sunglasses and loose change (in the top padded pocket), at least 3 t-shirts / shirts, a pair of jeans, trousers and shorts (in the main compartment) and a pair of slippers (in the bottom compartment). The bag looks like it\\'s about to explode, but that\\'s just an illusion, as there\\'s always some space here and there.For people who want to use this bag for air travel, two things to keep in mind - the side zipper for laptop access and the hooks in the front. The side access for the laptop is really convenient for quickly getting the laptops out during security. As for the hooks, I really like them as I attach a small pouch from the hook, just for some extra space. Plus since I carry a rolling bag, I\\'ve made provision of attaching the extended handle of my bag to the centre hook. This is unbelievably amazing while running from one terminal to another to catch a flight, while keeping your hands free. It\\'s a slight inconvenience because when the bag is full, the hooks stand in the way of getting the bag in the overhead bin. But a little shake here and there, and voila, it fits. Also I\\'ve been asked more than once during the security check to \"remove\" these hooks from the bag. Imagine asking Wolverine to lay down his adamantium claws!!Now for some areas for improvement:1. Due to the padded pocket on the top, the flap keeps falling down over the main compartment. This personally doesn\\'t bother me much, but might be an issue for some.2. There is a pocket on each the shoulder strap (very well placed I should mention). I would assume that this is for a phone and other trinkets. The only problem is that it\\'s too small for a smartphone. I usually use it for keeping my iPod nano and an extra pair of earphones.To give a rating to this bag (on a scale of 5):Build quality: 5/5Space: 5/5Design: 10/5 (wicked cool)Ergonomics: 4.5/5 (only because of the small pockets on the shoulder strap unable to fit a smartphone)Comfort: 4.5/5 (need some time to adjust the shoulder straps to individual height)Price: 4/5 (I did think twice before shelling out $200)Value for money: 5/5Overall, $200 well spent.', 6603: 'I love how this thing feels. Snug, contoured to my back, stable with the straps across chest and a main compartment for an 18-Pack of beer with spare room. lol I was looking at several packs and was bummed that I forgot to check if this one had a drain for the wetsuit compartment. It only has a bag thrown in it (which I have yet to use). Other than that, I am in no way disappointed.', 6604: \"The bag is different than what you are paying over a $100 for initially. The difference is there are no front steel ring carabiner points and no side carabiner points. Kinda, sucks as it changes the aesthetics of the bag, but it's still an ok look for the bag without them.\", 6605: 'Bueno material de contruccion, con refuerzo en la parte posterior y con suficiente espacio para 4 conjuntos de ropa, los accesos laterales amplios para guardar los accesorios, en el lateral guarde una botella de agua 20oz, y quedo sufuciente espacio para muchas cosas mas.', 6606: 'The perfect travel duffel! Everything I wanted, exactly as described. I love the padded sunglasses pocket, plenty of room to organize gear.', 6607: \"I travel every week all week. I had a super nice leather bag before this one but it wasn't quite big enough for the whole week out on the road. This is perfect!!\", 6608: \"Yes. This the best backpack I've ever owned. It's sturdy and its hefty material it's built with, makes it almost indestructible. One nice feature is the metal buckles. Strong enough to pull up the bag without breaking, not like those plastic buckles on other bags I purchased before.\", 6609: \"I have about 60lbs of gym equipment (handles, chains, belts, etc) in my Mechanism and beat the living **** out of it 5-6 times a week. A month in the bag hasn't even begun showing signs of wear and tear.\", 6610: \"Love it!  Tons of room!  Love all the pockets, I don't have to dig in the bottom of the bag for keys or chapstick.  There is a pocket for everything!\", 6611: 'Great sturdy gym bag with plenty of room for guy stuff and man size shoes. Fits in most membership gym lockers but just barely', 6612: \"I bought this pack right before a trip to Jackson Hole Wyoming last February. It's a good size for a snowboarder like me. It was great for the resort where I could pack it with layers of clothing that I either would shed, or pack depending on the weather. Extra gloves, sweatshirts, socks, etc. It big enough for that, and a water bottle and a few snacks. I did one back country trip with the pack and if you only do this on occasion, this pack will likely suffice. However if you like to do back country often and long trips, (not like the 2.5 hour hike I did and 10 minutes down.) Then I'd recommend a larger pack. During  my hike up the Teton pass I had my board strapped to the pack, and the pack was filled with snacks, an avalanche shovel, and on the way down I had to put the hiking poles in as well. The hiking poles stick out the top a bit since the pack isn't quite long enough.  In the off season I use this as my motorcycle back pack. I fit the cold parts of my lunch in the front pocket with an ice pack and put the rest in the main pocket.\", 6613: 'My son loved it, just as they said it would be!  GREAT bad!!  Got to me quick!

I found these to surprise my husband and he wears them proudly! He was so elated!!  He wears nothing but Oakley and this is his style of frame so it was a no-brainer.  The quality is true Oakley and these will be saved as &#34;the good pair&#34; and not &#34;the work pair&#34; for years to come.  None of his friends or family had ever seen them before.

The lenses have a very cool look.  The lenses are very clear.  They cut down on the sun glare to just the correct amount (i.e. not too light or too dark).  The lenses were also easy to put into the frames.', 6653: 'I will start this review by saying that before ordering these lenses that I tried to order lenses from 2 other companies that carried Oakley replacement lenses and both times I was shipped the wrong lenses for my Oakley Titanium Crosshair Sunglasses. My original lenses became scratched after my sunglasses made their way to the bottom of a Pebble Tech Pool. Now there are 3 different styles of Oakley Crosshair sunglasses that have been made during multiple years. There is a Original Crosshair, a Crosshair 2.0 and then the Crosshair 2012. All three of these Oakley Crosshair models are completely different from each other and the lenses out of one will not fit the other. I was originally shipped the original Crosshair lenses and those did not fit. Then I was shipped the Crosshair 2.0 lenses and those also did not fit. Then Amazon finally started carrying these lenses so I took a chance and to my surprise these were the correct lenses. These lenses will only fit the Crosshair 2012 model or the Titanium Crosshair model. If you need lenses for Original Crosshair or Crosshair 2.0 then look further because these lenses will not fit. I know my review may seem long and ridiculous but trust me that it is a pain in the a-- trying to decipher which lenses fit which models and even the Oakley website is not much help since they have contradicting descriptions even in their information for the Crosshair 2012 replacement lenses. Now to the lenses themselves, they are genuine Oakley lenses and fit perfectly. They were shipped in the genuine Oakley lens box and guess what? They are even $5.00 cheaper than directly from Oakley. These lenses are the Oakley part number 43-492. I hope this helps someone that may be looking for Crosshair 2012 or Titanium Crosshair replacement lenses.', 6654: 'I finally found them and right what I was looking for. Excellent price and the same ones my original lenses had.', 6655: 'I was cautiously optimistic about these lenses. I had ordered these thinking they would fit, but they were for the newer generation of Oakley Twenty frames.

Would use vendor again.', 6657: 'Sweet glasses to sport around town.  I purchased these over a year ago and they are still in great condition.  I really do like lenses and style of the frame.  Also, the frames &#34;arms&#34; will pop off the hinges if they experience any pressure. Great idea so they will not break.', 6658: 'I love Oakleys, I have 25 or so pairs, and these are pretty good.

The distance between your nose and the inside of a lens will be very close to the distance between your cheek and the outside of the lens, as they are very curved.  They fit my very large head, which is always a coin toss with sunglasses.  The lenses are very large for men's sunglasses.  Don't get me wrong, they look great, but if you have a small face these may not be for you.None of what I stated above is a negative, but it may be for others.\", 6662: 'Escojo esta calificaci&oacute;n por que llego a mis manos el producto que yo eleg&iacute;, con el catalogo funda original .', 6663: \"Actually were purchased for me without realizing they were men's.

I even wear them in the rain to keep myself from squinting against the drops.  The arms on these glasses are secure, yet aren't so tight that they cause headaches from the pressure.They are durable and can handle the abuse I give them on the soccer field. I have dropped them on the field and had them stepped on by the players multiple times and they have held up.No screws in the arms means the arm pops off and is easy enough to pop back in.The only difference between the two pairs?  The polarized lenses take a little getting used to.  when I look at my phone with glasses on, the screen looks filthy.\", 6666: 'Great set of glasses that is a one size fits all.

But if you like bold, statement pieces-this will definitely fit the bill. And it's quite comfortable on the wrist- a nice benefit of Titanium instead of stainless steel and a rubber strap instead of a bracelet.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the hands-hour, minute and white part of second's hand, have luminescent properties, as there was no mention of this-including on the Oakley website itself. So, that was a nice discovery and benefit.Lastly, I should mention that although more than one pic online shows a half purple/white seconds hand- which I thought looked awesome- it's yellow/white-which looks great and compliments the overall look.\", 6680: 'Excellent product, like i want and like a photo, excellent sunglasses, excellent conditions, this sunglasses are excellent to do exercises.', 6681: 'i have bought the crossslink switch and this crosslink , comparing both, i find that the crosslink is more comfortable wear as it is much lighter then the switch.

These are nice.\", 6771: 'Hello!  The wife and I love Oakley flip flips (sandals)!  I have about 10 assorted pairs, some dating back as 2004, so I can compare quite well to other Oakley editions.To start, right of the package, these are quite comfy and fit well.As for sizing, I ordered size 14, as they were out of 13s, and they fit just fine really, even though I can be anywhere from a 13, 13EE, 14, 14W, depending on shoe manufacturer and allowing for variances among them.  The wife is size 8.5 women, and she ordered size 7 men, as she does for any men\\'s sandals or sneakers she likes, and they too fit her fine.  Again, both these fit absolutely fine.Moving on ... although to early to tell \"endurance-wise\", they seem to be well constructed.  They\\'re made of full-grain leather that feels soft and looks very nice, and also of \"Unobtainium\" rubber on their pretty good traction outsoles.  As such, they have good grip and tack on many surfaces, including some wet surfaces, although I\\'m not recommending you run poolside with them, or thru a slippery, wet bathroom floor at the gym.As for foot comfort, they have a very \"cushiony\" feel to them when I walk in these, with a \"fair\" rating for arch support.  These are made with what Oakley calls their \"Red Code\" midsole cushioning support system, and that is quite a nice comfy, \"spongy-ish\" kinda cushioned feel when u walk, and as such, make a fine pair of come-home-to and/or casual wear sandals. In addition, they\\'re made with a Microban\\'s antimicrobial technology.Look-wise, I picked the brown/white ones and have gotten several compliments from friends already, so they seem to be nice looking, not just to me (who shelled out the money for them and would thus probably have a bias ... lol), but thankfully to others as well! :))Definitely for a pair of Oakley\\'s for less than $20 w/ the FSSS deal ... what a steal ... I would order another pair!Hope that helps!', 6772: 'They are good looking IMO and comfortable right out of the box.Only they are slightly smaller than usual but otherwise I love it.', 6773: 'This was a replacement that I bought for a piece that I had lost in my travels. Perfect fit for me. If this gets worn out, I will get another one.', 6774: \"Nice design. Looks like the pictures, super comfy as expected of oakleys .in fact I think I like them a little more then my reefs.I wear US8 (for my reef as well) and it fits to a t.After wearing for extended period of time, there is something at the strap that cause abrasion on my feet.. Perhaps it's a product defect..\", 6775: 'Love it, this slippers are very well made and comfortable.  If you are looking for a pair of casual flip flops, I would definatelly recommend these they are awesome!!!', 6776: 'the product is a good product but u will need to order 1 size up 1 I am size 11 and needed to size up to 12 but I still wear them and they are still comfortable and I believe once they break in they will be a better fit', 6777: 'The Only downfall to the flip flops are the top part is rubber so caused blisters for first bit while wearing', 6778: 'love the sandals...great style, fit great and very comfortable...hard buying items like this online without seeing or trying on but definitely exceeded expectation when they arrived', 6779: \"Bought these for a vacation trip last year.

Son muy suaves y la suela se nota q es muy duradera', 6781: \"These are great.  They fit as expected and are extremely comfortable.  Only draw back is in hot climates your feet don't breath as well as with other flip flops.

The original supercoil is still the best one they have made as newer versions seem to have a thinner part that goes over your foot and not quite as soft/comfortable.  The crater flip flops are surprisingly comfortable.  I was leary about the crater bumps at first and wondered if I would feel them on the bottom of my feet.  The key for me is to have a  snug, soft spongy feel and not a hard rubber.  They did not disappoint...a spongy feel and comfortable to wear all day.  I do find that the sizing will most Oakley flip flops is a little off.  I normally wear a 10 shoe size, but I find the 11 is the right size and a snug fit....with flip flops I find a slight amount longer is better to avoid scuffing toes or bumping feet in general.  The price is not a deal but for a good product, well worth it!', 6789: 'I first saw these in an Oakley store but they did not have my size. Fortunately, I found them here. They are really comfortable, have a nice thick foam padding and soles that grip just like shoes. I love to wear these around and will soon buy another.', 6790: \"After debating between several of Oakley's new flip flop/sandals I decided on the Prime 2's... Although they were a little pricier the construction is great quality and I can wear them coming off the golf course or out with a pair of khakis.\", 6791: 'This is the third pair of slippers we got from Amazon. Like the selection of Oakley slippers they have. My husband always looks forward to receiving the slippers.', 6792: 'In most shoes I wear a size 10m. The length on these are perfect. My foot is not wide at all, sometimes depending on the shoe brand my foot falls under the narrow category. These are a little tight on my foot nothing to serious, but I have only wore them a handful of times and expect once they have broke in they will loosen up.The style is perfect for dressing something up or going casual.', 6793: \"These fit right and are very comfortable. They are about $15 cheaper than buying in the Oakley store.

Good job Oakley.  Thank you.', 6798: \"These slippers run a half size small, but they are comfortable and nice looking.  Got a pair for my son and recognized then that they ran small, so when I ordered for my husband who is a standard 9, I bought the 9.5 and they fit perfectly.  He loves them so far.  I didn't give them a 5 because of the fit, otherwise I would have.\", 6799: 'They are of very good quality and very well built, so far I have not had any problems and its setting is very good', 6800: \"If a pair of flip flops can look cool, then these are the ones. I got these just in time for summer and wore them quite a bit. They're fairly comfortable, with a nice padded sole. Only complaint is they run a little large and I wish I'd gotten a size smaller.\", 6801: \"I purchased these as I have grown to enjoy Oakley Men's sandals - even though I am a female. These fit very well and are comfortable and last for years; however, I do tend to buy a pair each year just to have them for spares, so that I can wear the older pair at the lake or beach and not worry about not having another fresh/clean pair. (Styles change each year)....Great for women with wider feet.\", 6802: 'Bought this for my husband.  He previously owned a pair of Oakleys and it was time for a new pair.  I ordered these as a gift.

Oakley has a 90 day warranty on the sandals but I called and explained the issue along with an email with a picture. Not more than 1hr passes by and the Oakley rep called me back and says he will send me a brand new pair. Now that is customer service.These are very comfortable and fit perfect for me. Definitely worth a shot trying these sandals for anyone that doesn't own a  pair.\", 6810: 'They are beautiful, nicely styled, and super comfy. They actually... fit like a glove. I got these to replace my leather pair which ripped after many years, and it was hard to decide on one style, but for the price, this was a great pick.', 6811: \"I have the same flip flops from 2009. They are so comfy. I am a 42.5/ 9US shoe and it fits perfectly. I can even run in these. The design changed slightly. But they are still awesome. Will get them again when these wear out. I've had friends borrow my Oakley flip flops and comment how comfy they are.Would've given it 5 stars but it dropped in price a week and a half later! But I'm still happy with them.\", 6812: 'Love it!  My new flip flops were exactly as I expected. I have had a pair before, so I knew what I was ordering.  They are the best!', 6813: 'I\\'m writing my first review in Amazon after a long quest on finding the perfect flip-flops.I\\'ve tried quite a few, including the Riders men\\'s cape VI or popular Reef fanning. I went for them based on Amazon\\'s \"all time best selling and best reviews\" in sandals. I checked those two, among others, but also made a hell of research on reading and comparing many reviews for these and other sandals/flip-flops.For my part, I can tell that these are the most confy I tried, reasonable quality (although I still need to wait a few months to really know, will try to post then) and unbeatable for the price (just 26$). Although some claim it runs too big, it goes perfectly for me- although my feet is in the narrow-ish side, and the major complain for this one is being narrow. I ordered my size (12) and one size bigger to make sure I got the right one, and 13 is too big, so I kept 12.Cushioning is perfect, the bed foam is very soft, same for part in the top of the foot and toe stripe is of very soft fabrics too, vs. piece of plastic that ruins many flip-flops, like some models of Crocs or Riders; Oakley supercoil is also on the light side vs. the soft and confy, but kind of heavy Reef fannings. It adjusts to the foot just nicely: not tight, not lose.All in all: If you are looking for the best flip-flop (confy, reasonable quality and good priced), take advantage of my research: I\\'d recommend to give this a try.First update- Sep, 6, 2013: regarding durability, a 5/5 stars on the short-term. After wearing them every other day in the city (currently in New York) for about 2 weeks, I\\'ve worn these flip-flops for a week around Riviera Maya, in Mexico, walking around beach, jungle, mud and rocky ruins, and they are still perfect and as confy as the first day (probably a bit more, as they are more adjusted to my feet). I will try to update in a few months for comments on long-term durability. So far, can\\'t beat this purchase.', 6814: 'Sent these to my son as a gift. He called me the day they arrived and told me they were the most comfortable sandals he has ever had.', 6815: 'I ordered a 10 because I usually wear a 9.5-10 but these sandals ran small.

However, I've owned more than one pair that hasn't lived up to my expectations, and so I feel at least somewhat qualified to give an unbiased review.The photos honestly do not do these shoes justice. The Brown is much darker, and much less &#34;grey&#34; looking than in the pictures provided. As far as looks go, I'm extremely satisfied.Fit and finish is great. I've owned my fair share of Oakley shoes before, and these fit exactly the same as the others. I went with a 12.5, and I'm generally a 13 in most other brands. I did find these shoes felt a bit narrow at first, but after a few days of wearing them they seem to have broken in very well.As for complaints, I have no major ones. I'm a bit concerned about how they'll hold up in the long run, as they feel somewhat thinner than some of my previous shoes, but if taken care of, I'm confident they'll last several years.\", 6826: \"Originally I bought these for the cool look of the Ruby Lenses on White Frame... Was even more blown away by the stunning clarity and comfort of the iridium lenses when I put them on!! Favorite shades in my collection that include other Oakleys and Maui Jims.

That backpack was discontinued so I went in search of something hard core, large and in charge.  I found it!!  So far the canvas is heavy duty, the metal hooks are so awesomely strong and the zippers seem really tight.  In another ten years I will perhaps be looking for a new backpack and not before.

Comfortable and very stylish.  Especially for someone who does not like having something between my toes so I cannot wear flip-flops!', 6839: \"they don't shrink in the dryer.

They are a gift and I will try to come back and post more reviews on the actual glasses as my boyfriend starts wearing them, but in the meantime I wanted to give Kona Sports a huge kudos for shipping time and an accurate representation of goods.  The glasses are exactly what I was looking for, at a great price and the shipping more than exceeded my expectations.  Super happy so far!', 6844: 'This jacket is very nice. It has snap buttons that are easy to work while wearing gloves, and I was surprised to learn that is it reversible. The reverse side is a black material, that I believe is waterproof, but I have not yet worn it during any sort of rain.One thing worth mentioning, also, is that this jacket is intended for individuals who are in shape. If you have much of a gut, expect this jacket to be tight when buttoned up completely.', 6845: 'Works great as a good light weather jacket for rainy and mildly cold weather. Not a cotton jacket though, it is a wind jacket.', 6846: \"It's super thin and packs away with a tiny footprint.

I have dressed it up with a sweater and heals and worn it casual with a jean jacket and flip flops.  It runs a little large and stretches just a tiny bit when you sit down in it for a whole day, so you can feel pretty comfortable going down one size.  This is a dress I can wear year round, which justifies the cost for me.', 6886: \"Overall a nice looking set of glasses.  Of course these were for someone else as a gift so I haven't tested them for durability.\", 6887: 'I have never spent more than $20 on a pair of sunglasses, but decided life near the equator justifies a high-quality, UV defense set of shades. I\\'ve had these for about a month and here\\'s the good and bad so far:GoodFrame material appears to be very durable. I have no idea what \"C-5 alloy\" actually is, but so far the glasses have taken some abuse without damage to frame or lens.I noticed the fit was very good right away.....noticeably so. The glasses contour to your face well so there\\'s very little light intrusion from the sides.The lens must be much higher quality than I\\'m used to, as I noticed right away the absence of any distortions.BadThe rubber-like material used where the frame makes contact near your ears easily slides off. Not a big deal, but for a hundred bucks I expected something more secure.All-in-all, the glasses are much better than the low-end versions I\\'m used to. It\\'s hard to believe you have to pay  so much to get good quality sunglasses.', 6888: 'Bought this as a birthday gift, after being skeptical when I saw the review that said the rubber ends fall off. The shades are about 2 weeks old now and they seem fine. I do not consider them to be &#34;big&#34; shades. They fit really well and is just the right amount of sporty with casual so it can be worn anywhere. I tried these shades on myself , and even as a female with a very different facial structure than the person it was bought for, found that it definitely fits snugly, color is nice, shipping was quick. It did come in a little pouch but not a real case.', 6889: 'My nephew thoroughly enjoyed them! They were a Christmas gift and and he wears them almost everyday.  The color is more like a red than a pink, so okay for a guy.', 6890: 'Gave these to my very hip brother for Christmas, and he thought I must have spent at least $100 on them. Awesome.', 6891: \"I bought this as a gift and it is a high quality product. Unfortunately, I had to returned because it didn't fit as I expected.\", 6892: \"It's thicker and clunkier than I thought it would be, but the overall style is great.  Time keeping seems to be perfect, as one would expect from this movement.  Even though I'm right handed, I prefer to wear on right wrist. This has a benefit, since the stem side of the watch falls toward the hand with vigorous movement...and that side of the watch is undercut on the back side so that there is little or no discomfort when the watch eventually slides down near the hand.  And, because of its size and weight, it will slide down.When wore on the more correct left arm, the non-stem side actually feels a little uncomfortable when it slides down to the hand because the bottom edge is not relieved as it is on the stem side.  Good and stylish watch overall, but you have to not mind large and clunky.\", 6893: 'Amazing watch, looks great, fits perfectly, and a little heavy.  Great price on Amazon compared to Oakley.  It is a solid watch, great crystal lens, masculine looking, and takes some getting used to because of the weight.  After a few days of daily wear I stopped noticing it on my wrist.  Keeps great time and easy to see day and night.', 6894: \"If you are looking for oversized glasses these are it, they fit me perfect so clear and light weight, I am 6'3 and 300 lbs and these glasses fit as if they were custom made for my big face\", 6895: \"I am a new Oakley wearer, a middle aged Midwestern suburban housewife, who has always had cheap Wally World glasses. I am a runner and a biker(road and Mtn) at heart, doing hundreds of miles in both activites monthly.I won a gift card to our local sporting goods store and went in with the intention of buying athletic Oakleys and that was it. I did(Flak Jackets) and was so impressed with fit and optical quality that I went back to get a pair for casual. I looked at the Fuel Cell and Gascan but for some reason, these big dumb gaudy glasses kept calling my name. The kicker was that they were called &#34;Big Taco&#34;. Are you serious?! Sold! I almost bought them as more of a joke but the joke was on me.I love these! They are so big that I don't see the frames surrounding the lenses(I normally hate most glasses for that reason!) and they fit darn near like goggles, but not as tight. I have to really try to look around to even see the frame or light peeking in around the perimeter. And the coolest thing about the Oakleys I tried......how did they make them fit so well with just 3 points touching my face?! Most glasses try to fall off my face when I lean forward but not these. I can run and never have to push them up on my nose(yes, even the Big Taco!) How they can make something so big disappear on your face is beyond me!I am a girl and small at that. I don't have cheeks but could see that the shear length of them could cause issues with people who have decent sized cheeks and the lower portion of the lenses digging in. So fit is personal, FYI.I can't wear Oakley sunglasses that have contrast lenses as they seem to let in too much light or the contrast just doesn't agree with my eyes as it causes headaches(NOT polarized, like some people report, for me, it is only the contrast lenses) and that limited me to what I could get stock in the Big Taco. But custom is always an option also if you like the BT but the colors or lenses don't trip your light fantastic.Love these! Fit is great! Quality is awesome! Price is good for what you get!\", 6896: 'Easy order and delivery was on time. I use the frames for a prescription lense.When my other frames broke I was able to find these at over half the cost if retail.No brainer', 6897: \"It's one of my favorite Oakley Sunglasses and it fits well in my round face.\", 6898: 'These glasses are great . The colors and style are awesome ! This is my sixth pair of oakleys and probably my second favorite !', 6899: \"I just read Hoon Lee's one star review and though I should put a 5 star to give these pair of sunglasses a boost. In terms of my actual star rating. I would say these are a 4 star pairs. It feels solid, tight hinges and overall a good looking sunglasses and the optics are clear no matter which way your eyes look while they are on your face.The fact that Hoon's name looks Asian, I'm going to assume he/she is, and that's probably the problem with the fit of these. Oakleys are not the best for people with a flatter/shorter noses as the nose bridge would have nothing to lay on. Before you start calling me racist...1.) I'm Asian and 2.) go Google it. For Asians or people with flatter noses, I suggest getting the wires if you actually want Oakleys as they have traditional nose bridges. Also some Jackets have larger nose bombs that will make the fit much better. The Big Tacos looks to have a slightly wider nose bridge and no rubber nose bombs so they really have to be on the right head/face for that perfect fit.Okay, here's my outlook on these shades. I'm a Oakley enthusiast and currently have a small collection of 19 pairs, I have the lower priced plastic/omatter ones as well as the higher end xmetals and one pair of Elite. I love them all. I'm a somewhat big guy at 6'1 200lbs and have little problem with the fit of the Big Taco. Because my head is large enough, they wrap around my head and is held on firmly enough for everyday casual wear. Definitely would not hold on if it was for a more active use, but that's not what these were meant for. I personally love the design/look aspect of this pair. especially if you get the matte bone and green pair. BTW, those green accent parts are metal.The fit of this pair fits my face very well to the point where there's little light leakage from the top/sides/bottom which is great. But sunglasses fit isn't universal so if you don't have my fat head, these may not feel the same...As with all sunglasses, I would say go try them out at the store before making a purchase. But the one star review was unjustified as it was purely for the fit which is too personal of a thing.\", 6900: 'These are perfect for my giant head.  They are big &#34;bug eye&#34; style and do not look small like most glasses on my giant frame.', 6901: \"This is my first pair of sunglasses that actually don't look too small on my face. I'm 5'8 300 lbs. yea. Like I said they fit my face but the bottom of the frames rest on my cheeks so when I smile the glasses shift up and it just looks weird/ funny spacing by my nose. obviously nothing to do with the glasses. I just thought I would share my experience with these. Other than that these are perfect.\", 6902: \"These shades are great for wides heads.  The only shades that fit me are both the Eyepatch and Eyepatch 2.0 and these Big Tacos.  You won't be disappointed.\", 6903: \"These fit really well. I have a big head and most squeeze my head and give me head aches NJ to to mention over time break at the nose price but these don't squeeze my head at all\", 6904: \"Most other sunglasses are annoyingly small for my big mug.  These are great, the lenses are also crystal clear.  I've actually purchased two pairs of these already.\", 6905: \"You can't never go wrong with a pair of Oakley glasses. The are kind of traditional, with a glimpse of a modern cut. Very light, although they aren't polarized, the view is spectacular.

Polarized lenses are really nice. My face is almost too big. I do see where other comments about your cheeks could be right. Mine do not lift off my face though when smiling. Great of the price.', 6908: \"Every excellent pair of high quality sunglasses I have purchased costs about the same. These at $170 are the same price as my last Oakley's and I bought them 10 yrs ago. This pair is very comfortable and great looking. They are of the highest quality. It is so much more comfortable out in the bright sun when you have this type of quality on your eyes. There is such a difference between high end sunglasses and regular ones in regards to fit and glare protection. I recommend this brand. I love this style; but style is a choice. If you don't want high end quality then don't pay outside your budget;and stop whining about the cost and stop giving bad ratings to great products based on your pocket book.\", 6909: 'reading some reviews first i thought thet were huge. actually im  a 7 1/2 cap size and been using the eyepatch 2. the big taco fit me well', 6910: 'They were bigger than i thought, i think this was the oversized version. Any how, they are still some piece of lenses', 6911: 'From now  OAKLEY product will go along with me.

Really light weight frame. They really meet my expectations!', 6916: \"Very nice and light. The dark gray shades are a bit much except in extreme sun. I get lots of compliments.

Great protection for my eyes !', 6923: \"I purchased these sunglasses in the Rose Wash color. They're really pretty and unique!

I am not wearing these for cycling and don't recommend them for sports, although I did wear them to run on the beach in Florida, and they were fine for that. I love the color and fun look of these sunglasses. I probably wouldn't have bought them if I had tried them on first because the frames are a bit large for my face, but they were good enough not to worry about returning them. In fact, I am not sure I could have returned them because the sticker that seals the box said something like, &#34;No returns if this sticker is missing or tampered with.&#34; So, I kept them and feel a bit self-conscious in them because of the size, but they do provide good casual-wear protection.\", 6929: 'I got these for my daughter who plays softball for her high school to wear during those sunny afternoon/evening games.

A touch of rubber grip by the ears and nose-bridge keeps them snugly in place without feeling tight.

These shades offer good protection against bright light with very little glare.  The lenses are iridium, so if you've never owned oakley before, be warned that they scratch very very easily.  take extra special care to avoid scratches.  Keep them in the soft vault that they come with and ONLY use the microclear bag to clean the lenses.  The second lense works great for low light conditions, improving contrast.  I use the persimmon when indoors as my safety glasses.  Common, cheap safety glasses give me headaches and hurt my temples.

This is why I keep coming back to Oakley, you may pay more, but they are so strong and the optics are the best!  I've tried Smith, Native and Bolle and they don't stack up (in my history of use).For a trip to Florida, I wanted a pair of walking, driving, laying in the sun, looking like a tourist pair of glasses.  These are AWESOME!  The color of the frame *Cosmo* is not particularly purple or berry, but a mix of both with a hint of brown.  Its very different.  The stems are elegantly thin with the metal Oakley icon.  I wanted these to be light, all day wearable glasses without that dreaded nose indent. I wore them the first day, ALL day in bright Florida sunshine and was extremely happy.  Very light, no glare, plus they look very good on me, if I do say so myself.  I think this shape would compliment any female face really.  Also, they provide a great deal of coverage from the sun.  Love these!\", 6974: 'What isnt to like?  The sunglasses dont seem to be round and are a deep purplish brown, but fit and sun blocking is very good.  Sunglasses are lightweight and comfortable.

I chose the brown frames with grey lens, and the lens is definitely grey, but I would describe the frame more of a metallic bronze rather than brown.  It is a nice color and I am please with it.

I was surprised though that they were clear, it was my fault for not knowing enough about lenses.  These glasses work great for golf just dark enough where my eyes don't hurt but clear enough to see the breaks in the green so I never have to ake the glasses off.  These re very comfortable and you won't have a second thought about them all day.  You ant beat the price and how fast they got here with amazon prime.

Everything you need to learn about the product you can do a quick scan on Google or what not. As a Garage Rock fan, this one is a must-have. The 24k-Iridium Polarized lens lends a modern shout to the more subdued and classic Tortoise O-matter plastic. That said, this pair is amazing.What's more Amazing, though, is the seller. I've read a lot of skeptical and (otherwise) scathing reviews of online sellers here in Amazon selling inferior, damaged products or even fake replicas. Glad to note that the guys from Beachcomber's Ski & Sport are all too accommodating when I asked them for any documentation/s that would attest that these guys are officially licensed to distribute Oakley products. They respond to email inquiries in less than 24-hour's time, showing official documents, taking photo of the product and even measuring the product by hand just to ensure that I get the proper measurements. The lengths that these guys do to ensure that you feel safe about your purchase is impeccable!Definitely recommending these guys! :)\", 6996: 'Satisfied with the glasses overall.

She's very active and spends time outdoors, and can't be bothered with squinting from the light. She says they really make it easy to see. I agree, I don't leave home without my Oakleys. I'd prefer to get the polarized lenses but these are fine. Oakleys are known for their quality, and I gave it five stars because, well, Oakleys are the best out there. I've invested in two pairs for my wife over the years. If you want Ray Bans or something, go ahead, throw your money away. If you want something that will take good care of you, stick with Oakleys.\", 7004: 'I love my Oakley sunglasses. The rubber on the sides keeps them from moving when I play sports.

I could care less that they are Hobbit glasses. Unless you look close they just look like cool Oakley's. They cost half of the original retail is why I bought these. I guess the rest of the world didn't have a high demand for Hobbit 3d glasses. The picture is very clear and I barley even notice the frames around the lenses. With theater issued 3D glasses the view is so restricted by the gram of the glasses I stopped going to 3D movies. Not a problem anymore.\", 7030: \"I love the clarity of these glasses. I've never experienced 3D movie the way I have with these.

I would be still wearing my first pair (purchased about 5 years ago), but I unfortunately lost them in the lake. These have been the only glasses that I've found that completely block out the sun from all angles. They are very similar to the current flak jackets except made for a larger head. My hat size is 7 1/4 - 7 1/2 inches for reference. Hope this review helps!\", 7045: \"These are my first pair of Oakley, and the last time I bought sunglasses was some ten years ago. First impression when I first got them out of the bag was holy cow these things are massive! These dwarf my other pair and cover a lot of ground on my face. I guess that's a good thing as they cover well below the eyes leaving only small skin below my cheekbones exposed to the blistering sun when I wear my helmet. Also, as big as they are these Monster Dogs are very light and wrap quite nice around my face. The only con I can think of is these have quite an arch and even when folded they are bulky. Not really a big deal but they take up a lot of space in my small satchel.3/21/14The iridium coating on one of the lenses started to peel off. It started with minute scratches in the corner, and a week or so later those tiny scratches magically grew 2-3 millimeters. I'm getting polarized replacements and hoping they don't peel. You would think for a company that makes glasses for athletes and charge premium prices for their shades that these would be unheard of. Sadly this issue is quite common.

The oakley eyepatch 2 sunglasses are really Oakleys not a fake brand.

I have a big collection of oakleys so i do understand when people post their \"they feel fake and cheap. im returning them\" comments. Just compare them to other oakleys and look for the little details on the arms. look for the name brand and logos printed and embossed on the \"o-matter\". they all have them. so if you think your been robbed, double check with other models first. you cant go wrong with oakleys. they will last a long time. mine have. i dont buy them to keep them in a drawer. i make them live up to their name. now! these oakleys are a bit oversize, so if u do have a small melon or a thin face like tom cruise, try them on first. google pics, do your research. you dont want to look like your wearing a welding mask. for example, the gascans that i also own feel small to medium on my face. gascans kinda resemble the eyepatch with the square design. i have a round head like leonardo dicaprio.  gascans are best fitted on small thin faces. the eyepatch2 feel big on me. the square design is not for everyone. specially with the black matte color. the purple and clear color have a different feel to them. they just feel right. might be the color i guess.i think i might order another pair of the same color (purple/clear) soon before they\\'re gone. with that said, also try the pit bulls and hijinx, oil rig, fuel cell, big taco and crankcase. they are big but they fit well on a round face. if you are going to order a pair and you need them fast, upgrade the shipping option. otherwise it\\'ll take 2 weeks to get to you. these did. then again they traveled cross country to get here.

He loves them and wears them all the time. Read a few reviews before purchasing that said they run big/wide... my son is tall and skinny and they fit great! He even wears them during baseball games.

Polarized lenses are great for wearing near/on water. I never have been disappointed with Oakley.', 7065: \"I really like the look and style of the Nanowire series from Oakley, feels like they put in a little bit of ingenuity that even Luxottica couldn't grind out of them. That being said, they don't really make these anymore for whatever reason- and while I do slightly prefer the style of the second Nanowire series- these are available for a pretty good price and they perform pretty well too.The polarization is very even, which is what I'd expect from a nice pair of glasses but also overall it seems a little weak, like polarization wasn't the emphasis but kind of a second thought. UV blockage is strong though, no doubt they'll protect your eyes plenty fine!Just be careful with the nosepiece, it bends pretty easy- the frames are pretty thin so please invest in a thick case should you pick up a pair, I'm still trying to figure out how to bend mine back perfectly- they're still a little off to the left.But for that Deus Ex minimalistic look I haven't seen a better pair around at a better price-\", 7066: 'REALLY GOOD I THINK THIS BRAND ALLWAYS SPEND THEIR PRODUCT WITH HIGH QUALITY.

My only issue with this jacket is that it looks longer in the picture than it really is. I have a pretty short torso, and I am only 5' 5&#34; tall, and this barely covers my hip bones. I was hoping for a jacket that was a little bit longer because as I said above, this is my running jacket, and I hate when cold air goes up my shirt.I'm still giving this jacket 4 stars, I really wish I could give it 4.5 because the ONLY downside to this jacket is the length. Everything else is great!!!\", 7080: \"Nice color, nice fit. I don't know when wahesd wats going to happen with the color but. They are ok\", 7081: 'I bought this Oakley crew for my trip to Europe as Paris in the Spring can be &#34;tricky&#34; weather wise.  We traveled to Munich, Zurich, and Paris, this crew worked perfectly and it looks great!', 7082: \"Ok first things first, I am 175 lbs, 5-11 and have some freakishly long arms and wide shoulders so I often have trouble finding something that fits in a large as its generally not long enough and I hate having sleeves that don't go down to the wrists. I have ordered a sweatshirt from Oakley before it was a large and fit a little snug then washed and dried and ended up having to pass it on to my girlfriend as it was not ok to wear in public looking like I can't dress myself. I ordered the Extra Large jacket as I was planning on using it as a zip up fall dress casual item to wear over a button up shirt. Fits great the sleeve cuffs are still a little tight at the end but can't be too picky. The color is a deep rich blue that works well with a lot of different colors. I have had numerous compliments on the color and look of the jacket. However the biggest factor in wearing clothes is how I feel in them and this zip up fits great. Glad I went with the Extra Large otherwise it wouldn't have fit properly.\", 7083: 'This jacket is well made and form fitting.  My husband wears oakleys and the two together is outstanding!  Love it.', 7084: 'I am 6 foot 7 and very long and skinny. I ordered an xl and it fit great! I weigh about 170', 7085: 'This sweatshirt fits perfectly.  I love how soft it is!  I will definitely purchase more Oakley clothing in the future.', 7086: 'Awesome shorts!  Material stretches nicely and does not absorb water.  I picked up an additional 2 pairs!  I highly recommend!', 7087: \"I play Beach/Sand Volleyball in these and would highly recommend them. they stretch well, and dry quickly.only issue is the white will get dingy if you don't take care of it immediatly.oh, and these are board shorts, so they have no liner... just an fyi\", 7088: 'I love this product. It was exactly as described. Perfect fit and held up well in salt water without fading.', 7089: 'Bought them for sons swimming at school, worked at expected, fit pretty true to size, may need something to wear underneath but other than that they have held up in washes etc', 7090: 'Fits snug and secure on face...comfortable fit and they look great on...may not be the best fit for someone with a larger face', 7091: \"Great glasses.  They fit nicely around my face and aren't too heavy.  I wear them for everyday protection and they fit so well that I wear them when I run too.\", 7092: \"I don't normally by anything too expensive for myself; but with the way I go through sunglasses, this was a no-brainer.  They arrived fairly quickly and in good packaging, with a micro-fiber bag included.  The lens allow me to see in the morning murk that comes with Spring, and I wear them while playing Ultimate Frisbee. I wouldn't suggest them for sports sunglasses, but they will work in a pinch.  I will definitely be buying another pair of Oakleys...as soon as I save up the money.\", 7093: 'Great value.  Lenses are high quality, frames are well made.  A good pair of sunglasses for sporting activities and driving.', 7094: \"I received a $20.00 off coupon if I applied for the Amazon Visa card which brought these sunglasses down to a reasonalbe price.  They feel solid. I am so tired of the arms of my cheap sunglasses falling off. I've been thru 3 pair of  $10-$15.00 sunglasses this summer and its only July.  Hoping investing in a quality pair pays off'Becky\", 7095: 'I bought these with an extra pair of gold iridium polarized replacement lens but the lenses of this signature model nicely adapt to various light scenarios.  I like them so far.', 7096: 'bought this for my brother..nice material arrived on time and was true to size..will buy again from this company if needed', 7097: 'I tried these on previously to buying them.. I love them. I have other Oakley sun glasses , they fit me well.This order was received in a timely fashion', 7098: \"I love the design of the glasses.  I fits me alright.  Unless you were looking for something rounder.  It's sleek and definitely good for sports!  and casual fridays! or nights!\", 7099: \"Found these here on Amazon.  Because of insurance, bought them from provider at ophthalmologist's office which bills insurance.  LOVE the style.  My skin is oily so, because nose pieces are attached rubber inserts, they are not always gunked up like the wire ones with the plastic pads.  AND, the soft temple arms grip my head comfortably without slipping.  No more painful wire hooks around my ears.  After LASIK eye surgery, I can't wear contacts anymore.  Being chronoligically gifted (I'm OLD,) I need slight distance correction and bigtime near correction for reading.  Who knew that I could get the correction I need AND a jaunty style that is also soooo comfortable.  I got the pearl color with cardinal color temples (also extra set of gray temples comes with glasses but not sure I'll ever switch them out.)  LOTS of compliments, I can SEE... and wear them in COMFORT.  Wow... just WOW.\", 7100: \"LOVE THESE!Perfect fit, won't move or slide on the face.Looks are great as well and I can see more clearer than ever before.The extra set of temples are a nice treat.\", 7101: \"Theses shades are amazing.. they fit perfectly and are very lite and comfortable. I have an old pair of Oakley Gascan and even though they are polarized, I'm finding these better than the gascan's. Have many good reviews about them and I'm not taking these off. You can't never go wrong with Oakley. Period.\", 7102: 'Nice glasses, but not really red (or iridium), they are more like purple.  But they fit well and are very comfortable to wear.', 7103: 'I love the Oakley Holbrook glasses more than any on their line. This was my second pair and look very nice.', 7104: 'My Ray-Bans were riding on my bent nose weirdly, so I got these. They look good and fit my longer face better than the Ray-Bans. They are very comfortable and I wear them almost daily when the suns just alittle too bright.', 7105: \"The sunglasses are great. I use them everyday and they are great for when I'm driving. Perfect purchase. Really recommend.\", 7106: 'Good article.It was a very good purshase, I looked for this product and I walked a long time and none. In Amazon I got it!', 7107: \"soft, but a little on the long side, but comfortable. stands out though&#8230;so if you don't want to be noticed get a dark tank top.\", 7108: \"Fit as expectedThis Oakley Men's O-Square Tee is confortableThis product was I hoped The size is as expected\", 7109: 'This shirt was a gift for my husband and he has worn it quite a bit already.  Nice, clean design and good comfy material', 7110: 'We bought this for my teenage son. Great quality and has a pocket for his MP3 player or phone inside the side pocket. It holds the device a little more securely and has a path to run headphone wires to keep them inside the jacket. Pretty cool set-up.', 7111: \"Nice army style green material, very soft and comfortable interior, it's actually fairly thin and not recommend if you're wanting a thicker hoody.  It's perfect for a slightly cool day or just something light to wear as another layer, but I'd recommend the thicker Oakley hoodies if you're wanting to wear one in colder weather.I didn't feel that the &#34;burnout&#34; or as the other reviewer said, &#34;vintage&#34; detail was really that noticeable, however this is definitely one of my favorite go-to Oakley jackets to throw on.\", 7112: 'This sweatshirt is really nice.  We ordered a Large and it fit good, but it did shrink when washed.  Thankfully, we needed it to shrink a little.  So just be a aware that it will shrink.', 7113: \"My daughter loved these!  They are very stylish - I'm thinking of ordering a pair for myself.  They look great!\", 7114: 'Super cute, arrived early, love them, blocks the sun perfectly, getting lots of complements on them already - case is not hard which is kind of concerning.', 7115: \"We bought these for my husband's birthday.

The carbon fiber frame is great,, every one likes them\", 7118: 'The tops are reversible.  They are soft, just the right size and comfortable. Good quality.  I bought this in two colors!', 7119: 'I am so happy with my purchase. I am a bit bustier although slim and yet the top covered all it was supposed to. Great colour too!', 7120: 'True American size small.  I know a number of swim suit tops are labeled as Asian small and this is not one of them.', 7121: \"Shh!  My wife looks hot in this swimsuit but don't tell her!  It fits just right. I bought the matching top and bottom for her.\", 7122: \"The best bikini top I've ever owned.  Fits perfectly!  I wear it for beach volleyball and love that it's adjustable without being a halter top.\", 7123: \"I love these bottoms.  I'm not sure what it's called, but the gel, glue-like stuff that goes around the edges on the inside in the back really helps it stay in place and keep sand out, which is great for when I play beach volleyball.\", 7124: 'This fit in the size I expected and provides the right amount of coverage.  It stays put, when swimming and even when I went down a water slide!  Comfortable and cute.  I liked it so much I bought another one in a different color!', 7125: \"I never usually buy anything online without trying it on at the store first... Especially Swim Suits!  I figured, Amazon has free returns if it doesn't fit right.  It fits GREAT!  No need to take advantage of the free return.  I love the fit and the color looks just as great physically as it does online.\", 7126: \"This is a great top that fits well, but is not a light green as shown.  It's actually more of a neon green.  Very bright!\", 7127: \"Ordered this bikini top for my wife, who always likes Oakley swimwear.  Quality of the fabric and cut are excellent as always with an Oakley bikini.  The included strap is detachable for those looking for a bandeau style top or just looking to not get tan lines at the pool or beach.  The inside of the bikini has a grippy feeling to make sure it does not slip down and stays in place while you are wearing it.Only deduction of a star is due to the fact that the clasp is extremely difficult to hook in.  While this is a positive in the regards that you know the hook and clasp are not going to come undone, it can sometimes take a couple of minutes to work the hook side down through the clasp side, requiring you to jiggle the hook through and really have to work to make sure it gets all the way though and is secure.  Otherwise, it's an excellent top that looks great.\", 7128: \"I love the fabric of this bikini, and I love the style of this top.  It even fit me perfectly with my first choice of sizing!!Unfortunately, it arrived in the mail without the straps included.  Usually, this would be a minor inconvenience and I'd just request the straps or a replacement top.  But after several other issues with other components of this bikini, I was over it.  I returned everything and bought something from Target to tide me over until next year!!\", 7129: \"very comfortable and you can move in it with water sports, etc without causing a slip or flashing something you don't want to flash.\", 7130: \"I am very active - was looking for a suit that would stay put and still look like a 'girl'.  This suit totally fits the bill.  I had to order one size up in the top to keep me covered.  I really loved the adjustable back for a perfect fit.  I don't think they make this suit anymore.  I actually own two - wish they would make them again - I'd buy more!\", 7131: \"Love this suit. The eco green turned out to be more green than I expected but awesome none the less. I'm 5'6 120. I got the top in small and it fits awesome and the string bottom in medium which also fits perfectly. I love that I can play frisbee, volleyball or whatever and get support and not worry about falling out of my top!\", 7132: \"The swimsuit is well made and cute.  I could handle a little more support, but it's pretty good for having no underwire.\", 7133: 'This top fit perfect and I was able to switch sized form top to bottoms and would buy again when I can.', 7134: 'I usually wear a size 8 in bathing suit bottoms, and the medium was a perfect fit.  Very nice color.  Great quality', 7135: \"I got these because I needed a new black swim suit bottoms. They aren't a black really as much as a gray/black. Still looks great & fits well. I would recommend this.\", 7136: 'great fit and comfy', 7137: \"I am large busted, and the push-up in this top is epic. The combo is pretty boobalicious, but not over the top. I like the top and it's comfortable and easy to adjust. The pink color ran, even though I followed washing instructions, and is now very faded. This is more of a heathered hot pink to begin with, I know it sounds weird but seeing it in person makes that make sense.\", 7138: 'I wear a 36D/34DD and ordered a medium and it fits me perfectly.  It seems to be a really good quality top.', 7139: \"I purchased the matching bottoms from Oakley, but this top is great. Love the bikini overall. I took out the extra padding- it was just a bit much. It's still a bit much in the push-up department, but it's better than looking like a 12-year old. I would recommend this top- it's very well made.\", 7140: 'I wear a size 36B and this fit perfectly.  It is sexy and bright.  I love the way it fits.', 7141: \"I couldn't find a sizing chart for this top...ended up sending back a few times to get it right.  I wear a size 32 A cup, which ended up being a x-sm.  Color is true to what you see online, neon pink.  I like it so far, will have to test it in the water though.\", 7142: \"Summer is just around the corner and this new top hits the spot. I've been wearing it in my yard to get a start on a tan. Fits beautifully and has that I'm sexy look and feel.\", 7143: 'I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I love this suit, as a \"bathing\" suit, rather than a \"swimming\" suit.  It\\'s great for hanging out, but not for any real swimming.Pros: Fits great, looks great, very comfortable!  I like it so much I bought it in two colors.  (And I very, very rarely find a top that I like.)Cons: The \"padding\" holds a lot of water - making it \"flop\" forward when I swim (quite a show, yikes!) and also makes it slow to dry.  I wish Oakley would make it without that padding; it would definitely be a better suit without it.Again, this suit is great for playing around/in the water.  I\\'ll definitely wear it for days when I\\'m on a standup paddleboard, at a pool party, or relaxing at the beach.  I\\'ll be sure to wear something over it (rash guard) if I plan to swim, surf, etc.  (Oakley, how about taking out the padding, and selling rashguards and boardshorts to match?!)', 7144: \"I always want to wear a bikini top, but my (natural) 34DD chest doesn't fit most swimsuit tops. Either the girls spill out the top, side or bottom. But this top keeps them in and gives them a lift. I bought an XL for those of you trying to figure out which size to get. Thank you Oakley for letting me wear a cute bikini again with confidence!\", 7145: 'I love the bottoms.  They seem well made.  I usually wear a medium in bottoms so I ordered these in a medium and it was a perfect fit.', 7146: \"This is my favorite bikini bottom I've ever owned!  I play beach volleyball in it, and the silicone lining definitely helps keep sand out!  Fits great!  I generally am not big on brand names, but after this will buy Oakley again and again for my volleyball bikinis!  Definitely worth the price!\", 7147: \"I initially ordered a medium in this bottom as I am an 8 in pant size. However, it was a bit small so that it fit tight enough to cause overspill of skin and fat on my love handles. returned for a large and it fits perfectly!  It stays in place and doesn't pinch or bind. Also ordered the top in orange flame which looks like it isn't the same orange at all. But they are a match and is made more for an active user instead of just a bather.\", 7148: \"The fabric of this bikini is wonderful!!  And I love the &#34;silicone elastic&#34; feature for a great fit around the edges.  It definitely comes up pretty small... so if you're generally between sizes, aim high.Unfortunately, I returned these due to too much hassle with the matching bikini top(s)... I didn't know ordering a bikini would be so complicated!!\", 7149: 'Fits Perfectly and True to Size. Orange color came as pictured. Crossed my fingers since I was purchasing just before a trip abroad. Very comfortable, and stays in place and does not pinch.', 7150: 'I would buy Oakley again and again  now, very impressed!!!!! came in on time and fit perfect for my body shape.', 7151: \"I haven't worn a bikini since before my children, much to my husband's dismay.  This cover up was our compromise.  It shows everything it needs to show and hides everything it needs to hide with a bikini underneath.  Held up great on our Caribbean vacation and continues to do nicely weekends at the beach.\", 7152: 'i liked fit good and i have compliment, i recomended y usuali M and i buy L an fit me ok', 7153: \"Very cute cover up for the summer. I love that it's see through but the stripes make it look classy. Love it.\", 7154: \"doesn't fit me at the length shown on the model, reaches me at knee, i am 5'3&#34; tall and 100 ponds\", 7155: 'Looks really good on. The material is very soft. The color is a true white. There are gathers up to the elbow on the front of the sleeves.', 7156: 'I love this shirt. It is a 1/2 size bigger than normal shirts, but I think the style is suppose to be warn like this. I wore it over my bikini at the beach and it was surprisingly warm. I was able to just wear this till 10:00pm, while other girls had to wear sweaters or a jacket. It is very comfortable and I would definitely buy it again. Great price also.', 7157: \"Ordered this bottom with matching top for my wife - she really likes the Oakley swimwear and enjoys the way it looks.  Fabric is comfortable and durable, lasting several washes in the washing machine after days at the beach.  Fit ran true to size - meaning that if you know your size in Oakley, it fits the same, but the Oakley size chart is also spot on with what fits you.  The back coverage is moderate enough for someone looking to be conservative (meaning you don't want to have half your butt hanging out), but is also modern enough to give you that 'cute' look without showing off a lot.  Overall, pleased with the purchase and will continue to buy Oakley swimwear.\", 7158: \"Great color, true hot pink my favorite. A little tight but im sure it will stretch in time. Would of liked if it didn't have the extra tie in back\", 7159: \"I'm 5'7&#34;, 138 lbs, 36 B/C, the medium fits perfectly! I like the extra strap going across the back, gived it a beachy flair.\", 7160: \"cute style, good material, good fit! i like the inside print more but it still has the seam lines even though the product is 'reversible'. nonetheless good value and very flattering on the tummy!\", 7161: 'This suit runs a little bit big but feels comfortable! The colors look better in person than they do online, as well as the material used on the suit is high quality!', 7162: 'I am a sucker for plaid, so this bathing suit was perfect for me! Very comfortable, good quality, and the colors are really pretty and vibrant. Boyfriend loves it!', 7163: 'Fits perfect. I live a very active lifestyle boating scubadiving camping and hiking. This suit is well fitting and does not get out of place. Stylish and functional.', 7164: \"This suit gives you great coverage and doesn't move around on you too much even when you very active. I love it, stylish and functional\", 7165: 'The jacket is awesome!!! Love it. Best looking jacket on the mountain. Keeps me warm and this was the best price by far.', 7166: \"I have had oakley sunglasses for more the 20 years diferent styles.

I bought a lot of flannels and these are my favorite', 7170: \"Perfect jacket, I wear it quite often. The inside material helps a lot against the wind. Only flaw is the buttons are starting to fall off, they aren't the most secure.\", 7171: \"This jacket was a lot warmer than I was expecting it to be! It also has a nice slim fit, which is good for a taller guy like me. I'm not in love with the hood since it is a little small, but I have a large head so whatever.For the price, this is more than a bargain!\", 7172: 'Purchased for campus wear and meet all expectations.  Only one small drawback and that is that the buttons come off easily.', 7173: \"I purchased this jacket with intentions of it being not up to the quality. The price was super cheap, so I planned for you get what you pay for. Well lets just say the quality is worth 100.00 the cost was a fraction of that. I'm so pleased with my purchase that I'm speechless.\", 7174: \"Other than being a bit pricey for a tshirt I think it's great!  The colors are as shown, fabric is quality, and fit is accurate!\", 7175: \"They're light and stylish. I bought these to replace the Oakley Mars that I lost and I wanted to try something different. I'm a little worried about the arms, as they seem like they might be delicate, but so far they're great glasses\", 7176: \"Once Again Oakley has made a pair of glasses that excel above the competition.  I've bought numerous types ofOakley's in the past & I've never been disappointed in any of them.  They're comfortable, just the right size, stylish for use while dressed professionally and they do a great job blocking the sun while not losing the ability to recognize what's around you, especially while driving.  The feel sturdy so I'm not afraid to wear them.  I would highly recommend them.\", 7177: \"These sunglasses are so great! I have a fairly big head because I'm 6' so I'm always looking for kinda big sunglasses.

I hadn't seen them before, but I loved the squared off bottoms of the frame. They fit great and I love the way they look.

Great looking sunglasses!', 7180: \"I was searching for sun glasses and came upon this model. I immediately wanted to own a pair.  I checked the different colors and picked the Brown Smoke ones. When I first put them on I was amazed at the clarity and how well they fit me. This is not my first pair of Oakley's (I was issued them when I was deployed) however these has quickly become my favorite pair. I will test them riding my bike as well.\", 7181: 'These sunglasses are typical of what I expect of Oakley - great style and excellent optics.  The only drawback was that these glasses were too big for my face in the nose bridge area.  This caused them to sit on the top of my cheeks instead of my nose.', 7182: 'my husband has a wide head and these fit and look great. I will buy again. and would recommend to friends', 7183: 'Like many men, I have a wide face.  I have found that I need larger framed sunglasses with taller lenses to give me both full protection of my eyes from sun and glare, and to have a nice cosmetic look that does not accentuate how big my head is.These glasses fit the bill.  I have owned Oakleys for many years, mostly the polarized Hijinx.  They seemed to fit my face the best.  The Offshoot is slightly larger, providing better coverage.  The unifies one lens look is barely noticeable.  The basic black lenses are slightly more mirrored in appearance then the basic black highjinx, but again it is barely noticable (I do not like mirrored sun glasses in general).  The larger temples are proportional to the overall size of the sunglasses and are not distracting.Overall, excellent glasses from the Oakley line.', 7184: 'I just wish they came in a polarized lens. Greaty style and quality for the price though! Definitely would recommend!', 7185: 'My boyfriend love his glasses...seen them on other sights but amazon always has great deals one of my fave websites', 7186: 'great glasses great protection and look awesome very pleased :)', 7187: 'Simply perfect.

I would definitely recommend them as a daily all around, stylish option for sunglasses.', 7194: 'looks good and feels great wearing it. lightweight too. i wish i had darker lens, though. =p but i like it.', 7195: 'a great sunglasses, light and very useful, u can use this for all looks, i recommend!an excellent bought option.', 7196: 'Color of lense changes from red to purple depending on lighting.  LOVE these bad boys and get tons of compliments on them!', 7197: \"FYI, the pairs that list for $200 are polarized, the ones that list for $160 aren't.I purchased the dark brown chrome pair and love them. I visited a local sunglasses hut beforehand to try them on and knew they had the fit I was looking for. I compared the crosshair, plaintiff and plaintiff squared sunglasses. The crosshairs have huge lenses and are way to big for me. I even have a huge noggin and they looked enormous on me. In the end the plaintiff squared glasses had a better look on my face so they won out over the regular plaintiffs. The build quality is standard Oakley metal, very light & durable. I went ahead and bought a pair from Amazon and had them 2 days later with Amazon Prime. I love them so far.\", 7198: \"I use these glasses for everything from normal everyday stuff, to yard work, to shooting at the range, to just about any other outdoor task around the house and have yet to get a scratch or mark.

Very well built and look great.\", 7199: 'Light, good fit to me, more than I expected. One thing I disappointed is the place of manufacturing. If you stick with Made in the US, and I do, this is not your choice.', 7200: 'I love them, nice look and very comfortable, the only problem is the lenses are plastic and the first time I dropped them they got scratched.', 7201: 'Great glasses. A little heavy but they look great and are pretty comfortable. Do yourself a favor and buy the polarized lenses. A little more expensive but worth it', 7202: 'These glasses are very good glasses, the lenses are flat out amazing. The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because they were a little big for my head and because the lenses were lighter than expected.', 7203: 'These sunglasses from Oakley are GREAT! I had to adjust the nose piece to get them to fit correctly but once got that squared away these became my favorite pair of sunglasses. Lots of coverage and polarized is the only way to go.', 7204: 'I have been wearing these for about a month and so far I am loving the comfort and style.  I have always had an issue where the side arms of glasses would put slight pressure on the sides of my head above my ears when doing something physical and wearing them.  I have had zero issues with this. I have a slightly larger than average head and these are very comfy and never feel like they will fall off. Optics are great with no glare while still being able to view colors pretty naturally.', 7205: \"Great sunglasses comfortable fit. Polarized lenses give you a different aspect of what you'relooking at but definitely dims the suns rays.\", 7206: 'Oakley has been my go to brand for sunglasses because of their woman specific styles. I do not have irises (called Aniridia), so I am extremely photosensitive, and I had ordered these as a less sporty sunglass style to wear inside (like in a restaurant, stores, church, etc). These are stylish frames that retain the functionality of sport sunglasses; that is, they look nice but are light weight, durable, and have great coverage (keep out a maximum of light).First, the photos do not do these frames justice. The turquoise frame color is a little darker in real life. Second, the lenses are darker in real life than they appear in the photos and the iridium coating means the lenses are reflective (that is you can see out but people looking at you only see their own reflection)...I know Oakley lenses well, so I knew what they would look like in real life, but if you have never had similar lenses you may be surprised because they look significantly different in real life.The quality was excellent and I think they would hold up well over the long term like my other Oakley frames...some of which are 15 years old.As much as I loved these frames, I did send them back. I have a small face/head for an adult, and these frames were too big on me. The bows are a good length, so you do not end up with a lot of extra bow sticking out behind your ear. For me, the nose pieces and lenses were set too far apart so the frames rested at an awkward/uncomfortable place on my nose.', 7207: 'Much prettier color than you see here.  Very light weight.  Just the right size.  The case is way too big to carry but it comes with a soft bag.  Will have to look and see if I can find a smaller case for my handbag.', 7208: 'These were a big hit with my wife..she loves them and wears them quite often. Looking for great sunglasses, these may be the perfect ones', 7209: 'They make my wife look very sexy ..there are not too dark and block out the sun very good. Must have', 7210: 'These are the best sunglasses I own!  I have a petite face and these they fit perfectly.  They are light and have rubber pads on the nose and temples for comfort.  They look very stylish but I am also able to wear them while I go for a run and they stay put.  I did purchase the polarized pair, which only is available in black and tortoise.  I chose the tortoise and it looks great; however, I would have liked to have had more color options.  My only gripe about these sunglasses is that the word, &#34;polarized&#34; is etched on the bottom of one of the lenses, which can be a little distracting, but not enough to make me take off a star.  Although the price is pretty steep, these sunglasses are a great purchase!', 7211: \"I have a hard time finding frames to fit my slightly smaller asian nose and face shape. If you have a more petite/narrow adult head, these might work for you. My husband and I looked in the regular chain places (sunglass hut, mall kiosks, lenscrafters) but couldn't find anything optimal that wasn't overwhelming large or didn't adjust for the nose bridge. I wear them everyday, driving and being out in the garden.On southwest vacation, we visited a local optometry place and found a range of sunglasses. The salesperson who helped me said that the optometrist was trying to have a few frames available to fit a smaller faces. I tried them on, not having high expectations for the fit. Although I like Oakley's quality a lot. We were impressed! So, the style factor was a **10**! And the sunglasses actually fit perfectly on my nose with minimal slipping. They have great head & nose gripper pads that work well.I did have an issue 3 months later with the glue on arm temple pads failing & falling off. I took them back to the same optometry place and they called Oakley and had *improved* replacement pads sent to our home. It was a just such a relief to see that Oakley & the optometry place had good customer service. I am hoping that the design of the Oakley LBD does not get discontinued!! I am looking to purchase the polarized lenses for sunnier/glare conditions.Also, for portability, they fold down in a microfiber case nicely and do not take up a lot of space in the purse like other sunglasses with huge lenses. They are light, stylish and functional and they fit!!! YAY!\", 7212: 'I was looking to replace my current Oakleys.  Not only are they attractive but they block the sun very well.  I highly recommend these glasses.', 7213: 'Love them!!!', 7214: \"These are exactly what I was looking for in a pair of sunglasses: they're light on my face, the tint is perfect (I think it's a bit darker than it appears in the image here) for everyday wear and I love that the frames are a really subtle purple. This is my only pair of expensive sunglasses and they were definitely worth the money. I've been wearing them every day for a month. My only complaint is the case - it's massive and annoying to carry around. I just keep them in the little bag that came with it.\", 7215: 'I got theses for my girlfriends birthday and she is in love with them. She likes the quality of them and the gradient lenses.', 7216: 'Simply Great shades! Comfortable fitting! Cool shape! All day long polarised comfort when  i put it on over the weekend.', 7217: \"We all know you can't beat Oakley.

I have a small face and sometimes glasses slide off my nose. These do not and fit nicely on my ears.  They are light weight.', 7219: \"These glasses fit comfortably, are light and don't feel like they slip on my face. The nose piece is comfy and doesn't rattle.  I am slightly concerned that the arms won't hold up, seems like the bend easily. I'm wearing them every (sunny) day.\", 7220: 'Before I bought these shades, I chatted with Amazon, reason being, the product says they  55mm, but when you read the discription on these shades it says they are 60mm. Amazon confirmed that they were 60mm lenses, NO ladies, they are 55mm, perfect fit. I love these sunglasses, I am so happy that I went ahead and ordered them (just to satisfy my own curiosity), I was prepared to send them back. They fit perfect.', 7221: 'This Oakley sunglasses came in with good condition and pretty good workman ship. It is nice to wear it. This is not polarized.', 7222: 'I love large glasses and I have always warn glasses now that I had surgeryon my eyes I have gone crazy buying different sunglasses and Oakley is thebest I have found I now have three pair and looking for more.', 7223: 'GOT TO LOVE OAKLEY.

Excellent product, Fit perfect for my husband. the color is like the photo no surprise.  just perfectJ', 7227: 'Not much to say about these really. They are just as pictured.

I looked at different brands and I haven't found anything I like. I noticed someone wearing this jacket in the tan color (Ermine), and I liked the design. When I got home, I immediately located it via Amazon and placed my order.The jacket itself is 100% cotton, with a PU (PolyUrethane) coating. This is great for repelling some of the elements. In fact, two days after wearing the jacket, I got caught in a little rain. I was completely dry under the jacket.The design is very slick. I got the gray (Grigio Scuro) version. It goes with just about anything, and blends to the urban environment quite well. The cut is modern, and a little boxy for my taste. I'm 5'11&#34; with broad shoulders and upper body. The medium fits me very well around the shoulders, but it is a little loose around the waist. This is fine for me. This jacket is not designed for a slim fit. When I got the jacket, it was fresh and a little crispy. I've worn it for a week now, it has since softened up a little. I have good range of motion with in the arms and chest. It is comfortable for wearing in the car and for the commute to the city.So far, I am impressed with the quality. I love the Oakley branding. I like that the jacket is not too loud. I think the fit around the waist could be a little slimmer, but I am OK with the way it is.I would definitely recommend this jacket.\", 7248: 'Warm in the winter and great for the fall. Great sizing. Recommend this for the man in your life. I got it as a gift and love it', 7249: \"This jacket is top notch! I was looking for a jacket with a few specifics, and this did the trick! Its not too flashy, not too cumbersome, I have my concealed carry and I dont have to worry about printing, it looks great and is very comfortable. Keep in mind that it will be a close fit, so it'll hug you pretty close. Its a tad short on the sleeves for me in a XL, but im 6'7&#34;, so tall guys keep that in mind. You might get chilly in 32 and colder weather, but by no means is the jacket flimsy, you'll keep warm in most weather and it repels water very well. This is the best looking jacket I've owned, and the quality is what you would come to expect of Oakley. Buy this jacket!\", 7250: \"Bought it for my hubby in X-Large. He doesn't like close fit clothing or too loose clothing. He loves this jacket. Great fit and color. It goes with everything.\", 7251: 'great jacket, hard to find. If you can find one you should buy. It is very comfortable and very rugged.', 7252: 'This Oakley Operative Jacket (in black) looks so good in an understated way! It wears well and is true to size. It is not too thick (just like denim) but keeps me warm enough in 45-degree weather. It also repels light rain adequately due to its PU coating over cotton. Ran through the washer and dryer several times but  still manages to keep its shape and color to this day. Zipper and snaps are tight and strong. I love the double collar and how it stands well. The overall put-together of the jacket is well-designed and durable utilizing thick gauge thread. As far as how it looks on me, well, some of my dude buddies say I kind of look like a quiet badass clandestine soldier in it (i.e. operative) and a few of my female friends commented that it makes me look handsome (whatever). What I also like about it is that the brand Oakley doesnt \"shout\" its name too loud on it, though I must admit that I had to use some black sharpie on the metal Oakley logo on the back to subdue the shine a bit. I normally don\\'t rate clothing but I must say this is one instance where I have to give credit where it is due.', 7253: \"I like how this shirt fits and feels.  I'm kind of in between XL and L.

He was surprisingly super happy with them.  They fit well and look great.  He typically has trouble buying glasses because the bridge of his nose is a little wider, but these sit on his face nicely.  I have a small face and skinny bridge and they fit me as well.  So they seem to be a really nice fit for different face shapes/sizes.  Zero complains from someone (boyfriend) who reviews lots of products and has to have the 'perfect' item in order to be satisfied.\", 7278: 'awesome sunglasses i love the way they fit but id expect nothing less from Oakley :) different style and i absolutely love them!', 7279: 'I bought in blue and grey so I recommended the product, nice material good comfort and great price for this shoes', 7280: 'An awesome pair of sunglasses.

I love them and use sunglasses on a daily basis.\", 7283: \"I got these as a gift. This product exceeded expectations. Good quality. Nice packaging. There were two things I would liked to have in the description. First one is that the lenses are polarized. That was a nice surprise when we received. Wasn't expecting that.

With the wind gasket it proved to be great... the gasket does not fit perfectly but they accomplish what I was looking for.

It even has slots in which you can store pens and pencils.The front pocket can store anything between the other two pocket sizes. I personally use it to store a book or a CD or two, depending on the day.The material is sturdy and durable, and does not seem to degrade quickly.

They aren't the substitute for my lost Smith Sequel II but I didn't expect them to be. I'm glad I got the polarized lens and think it was worth paying a little more. The tone is a BIT light and I find that during magic hour, if I'm driving, I still need to shield my eyes with a visor.

These have CAM hinges, while the 1st generation do not. I own the matte 1st gen Pit Boss\\' and love them. But, this polished black version (which they made before) are superior in comfort. The 1st gen pinch the skull in back of the ears (at least mine anyway, and my head is not large). This new version has  better flexibility in the O matter, which does not pinch. They have also added unobtainium to the arms, which also improves comfort.Overall, I give these sunglasses, and the service from Amazon and Extreme Supply, a 10. I\\'m very happy with this purchase. They are expensive, don\\'t kid yourself. I debated for well over a month as to whether to spend $600. I got the 1st generation for around $400, which was a deal. I have been a devoted fan of Oakley products for many years, and this was a pair of sunglasses I could not pass up. If you can throw down $600 for them, I\\'m sure you will be more than impressed with the quality, technology, and comfort that Oakley has put into these sunglasses. As for whether they are \"worth\" $600, I will leave that up to you. To me, they are well worth it. I have read a few articles about these sunglasses taking close to 7 years to develop and manufacture. They are a piece of Oakley and sunglass history, that are a must have!', 7337: \"I own the original Pit Boss in Matte. I love them, don't get me wrong. But after the first day of wearing the, I thought they pinched my head behind the ears, as the arms are not flexible at all, very stiff. I also thought they needed rubber on the ears and nose to improve comfort, and the ability to be active in them, without worrying about them flying off. Then the PBII came out,and they improved on everything. The Hinge is a CAM hinge now and feels much cleaner, the arms are flexible O matter so do not pinch at all, and are very comfortable for all day wearing, and they added rubber, (Unobtanium) to the ear and nose! I was excited by the upgrades. I notice the elite logo is no longer present. I heard from Oakley that they have discontinued the elite series of sunglasses, and are planning to release something bigger and better. This is the reason for no elite logo. It will be interesting to see if this rumor is true. $600 is steep, however with oakleys you can always get a substantial discount on ebay. I orderd my Pit Boss II in Matte black with black iridium polarized lenses for $425 all in on ebay, and got them in 2 days after ordering, all accessories included. Including the wood collectors box, cloth bag and paperwork. I love amazon, but not worth the extra $175.\", 7338: \"My 7yr. old son has a small face and these fit great on his helmet and don't slide off his face.\", 7339: 'I thinks it is a little bit smaller for an average asian male but wearable. give good command of view', 7340: 'These goggles have a great lense for all light, even at the end of the day.  They look good.  Boys like the color.', 7341: \"I'm not really sure if this is Bona fide Oakley but it serves the purpose. A bit tough to apply (quite snug) but once it's on, it's on. The yellow is bright!  I definitely recommend the product.\", 7342: \"These are another fine example of an Oakley product. The fit is firm not to tight, but I would assume that if you have a big head they would squeeze on you after a while. I got the brown lenses and like them a lot but be aware they are not super dark. Frames are comparable toRay bans. Only thing I don't like about them is the piece above the nose. It has an odd ridge for no apparent reason.\", 7343: \"Like them a lot. Kinda panicked when I read a review of these that said they're fake AFTER I had purchased them. When they arrived, they came in a very official looking Oakleys box with a label and documentation. It also included the soft, microfiber cleaning bag.That said, I was still very worried about these being fakes. Took them to Sunglasses hut and asked an employee if they were authentic. He took out an authentic pair in the store and compared them. He compared their weight, materials, and markings. He verified that they were authentic Oakleys.The store associate only commented that my frame seemed -- very slightly -- stiffer than the one in the store. They didn't want to flex as much. We both figured it was a minor manufacturing difference. He still told me that they were authentic.Also, these are NOT polarized. But that's alright with me. The lenses have no imperfections -- crystal clear, and great color (brown lenses). If they ever break or get scratched, I might buy replacement lenses that ARE polarized.Overall, great sunglasses.\", 7344: 'The fact that this oakley twoface sunglasses are made in china doesnt mean that are FAKE. I saw the sunglasses in two oakley stores in Las Vegas, and yes; they are made in China. I asked one of the workers at the oakley store about this sunglasses made in China and he confirmed it. Thats why i did not buy them. The price at the store is $200.00 polarized. But if you like them, you shouldnt worry they look and fit nice.', 7345: 'do not buy any thing from amazon with out further investigation. the oaklys web site is set up for a reason. some times amazons cheaper some times oaklys web site is cheaper. you can even create your own design. awsome. i bought two pairs from amazon before i visited the oaklys site i regret it now. made my own pair. an they are truly bad a**', 7346: \"Feels sturdy, has another pair of brighter lens with it so that you could change it's looks. It was surprisingly easy to change from one pair to the other(lens).

I usually always have that problem. These pants are a bit tighter than my other pants in the same size, but I guess that is also why they stay put. Though being tighter they are not unflattering.

I'm very happy with them.\", 7362: \"No problems with these, great fit and they look good on her. Can't say that about every pair of sunglasses.\", 7363: \"These are nice to wear, light weight but they are a bit flimsy. Lost my sturdier ones and had to buy ones that were closer to the ones I lose and these were it. Slightly disappointed that Oakly made such flimsy glasses. The arms seem to a little hollow. I wouldn't pay $100 for these again, maybe half. For $50, yeah, these would be worth the money but still would be the same description. They are comfy though.\", 7364: \"I love sunglasses, and have a few dozen pairs of expensive brands.  I have a pretty average sized face and head, helmet size Medium, hat size 7 1/4.These have a classic look no doubt derived from the original Ray Bans, maybe even Oakley's own Frogskins.  Quality is as good, possibly a little better than what you'd expect from Oakley; meaning crystal clear lenses and impeccable finish.  They fit a little large on my head, but that's in style right now, but they're aimed at bigger heads I'm betting.  Only gripe is that the nose pads are too far apart for my narrow nose to rest on, so the bridge sits on the bridge of my nose and this creates a small pressure spot that holds all the weight of the glasses forward of the ears.  It gets uncomfortable after a few hours.  Because the bottom half is metal, they're heavier than glasses made entirely of O-Matter, like Jupiter, Frogskins, Holbrooks, Frogskins, etc.  Otherwise, very stylish glasses with a modern twist on a classic look.\", 7365: 'Purchase original products...specially lenses!Have bought from eyekon and did not fit well... frustrating!!!Oakley deserve original products!And your eyes too!', 7366: \"This has become my 'go to' sweatshirt.

Pretty soft for the price, but be careful not to dry it too often as the o will crackle.\", 7371: \"Husband and sons love Oakley, but note their shirts are more of a slim fit, not baggy.

Great sleeve length (mid bicep on me), great neckline, enough room around my chest and back, and slim-fit around the waist. Also a very soft and breathable fabric.

These fit all three.  I have been testing them out in prep for a trip to Costa Rica where I want to make sure I keep them on while ziplining, rafting etc - and I have put them through their paces.  The best thing about them - they are super light and do while they do hold tight due to the material on the sides, they do not pinch and annoy.

They are the darkest lens you can buy and still leagally drive, they are super lightweight and stay in place.', 7405: \"I did a lot of research on sunglasses before pulling the trigger on these. I'm very picky about sunglasses and normally won't spend this much on a pair. (Never bought Oakleys, but used to love me some polarized Arnettes.) I got the orange frames with Black Iridium non-polarized lenses. Exactly as described. Came with zippered wristlet case, a microfiber bag + extra nose pads to get a proper fit. Came in the retail box with all the paperwork + warranty info as expected.According to the Oakley lenses chart, the VR28 Black Iridium lenses have 18% light transmission rating. Protection index = Level 3. Ideal for bright light. But, won't function quite as well as polarized lenses. Reduces glare but will not eliminate it. Beware the dreaded glare off metal, cars, etc. Hurts the ol' eye orbs. Other than that, these are the best non-polarized I've ever owned.If you want to try this pair on, like I did: I will tell you they are almost impossible to find in a store since they are last year's model (2013).. I found that out the hard way.If you want polarized lenses, you can mainly find this style in white frames (with a rare set of black frames now and then) only if you are willing to buy them from person to person on other websites. It'll probably cost about 200$ as of right now. I picked my poison with these but would have preferred polarized... Such is life. :)\", 7406: 'Phenomenal sunglasses.

My face is smaller and it seemed like it was impossible to find a well fitting pair of glasses with good protection. I decided to cave and buy a pair of oakleys after rave reviews from friends and reading reviews. Product is light, comfortable, and carry a lot of sunlight protection. Oakley has yet to disappoint, I recommend not buying the cheap store ones and spend a little well deserved money on yourself. Any issues I have heard of with anyone I know personally were given a brand new pair by Oakley no questions even months after purchase from the manufacture. This truly is a great product line backed by a company that takes high customer satisfaction rather then just making a sale!', 7413: 'These are going to be utilized by my daughter while playing softball.

It is light weight and very comfortable to wear during running.  The sunglass block just enough light to reduce the glare of from the river water and the strong late morning sun.I would have given a five star it is wasn't for the fact that the product original packing is just a thin paper box, providing no protection against rough handling and potential scratch/breakage during shipment.\", 7416: 'Bought the Oakley glasses for a relative.

Dark tint for the day, overcast weather I use the second lens. I also bought a yellow lens for when I'm mountain biking in the bush. The lenses are really really easy to change.

Comes with the hard case and soft bag case.\", 7424: 'The only downside to this purchase was that the item (9182-12) is NOT a Radarlock Path but rather a Radarlock Pitch. I got suspicious when the item code from the item page stated (9181) while the order showed 9182. I later verified this with Oakley but it seems the only difference is the shape of the lenses.I am not sure if these are older or out of production, but I do notice that some of the newer ones have a couple of &#8220;holes&#8221; on the top of the lenses to prevent fogging.Having said that, I love these shades and the way it looks. These are almost perfect! I have tested the polarised feature of the lenses (it blocks off horizontal glare so you do not get the reflection of items you place on your dashboard as you drive) and they really work!As long as you are not particular about what the item is named and like the shape of this pair that you see, I highly recommend.', 7425: 'Cool looking glasses. Bright sunlight can overpower the fire iridium polarized lens. Should have gotten a black iridium polarized lens instead.', 7426: \"These are great shades!  If you're a Seahawks fan they are an awesome accessory when wearing a jersey.  I love the interchangeable lenses, the polarized iridium jade lens not only looks cool but is remarkable at reducing glare while leaving everything crisp, clear, and the colors true.  The OEM Oakley lenses are spend, but worth it.\", 7427: 'Came with two lens. awesome!! Beautiful frame and lens! Very light and stylish. Oakley never disappoint me!

It's my thrird Oakley and I having been using the first for 4 years... adsf adsf adsf adf\", 7429: \"Bought these to replace some older M Frames for use primarily while bicycling. They provide ample coverage, the vented lenses keep them fog free and the extra height give of the lens works great when riding in the drops (frames don't get in the way). Lastly, the straight bows fit perfectly under my helmet and the glasses stay put.I would recommend these anyone looking for full coverage sport sunglasses. Probably not ideal for smaller heads. There is a non XL version of the Radarlock.\", 7430: \"There's a reason so many people are wearing these things at every caf&eacute; ride, triathlon, and crit. From 18mph cruises to 6 hour aerobar assaults, sweat doesn't stick on the lenses and you can't see the frame no matter how hard you try. You'll forget you're wearing sunglasses until you take them off. They stay on, they cover half your dang face, and make you look much faster than you are. I bought these to replace my $50 Tifosis I've had for 5-plus years and just wore them in Ironman Louisville on Sunday. Hot and humid, biked 5.5 hours and ran 5 more in these bad boys and am completely satisfied.The TdF livery is cool, the color combo works well with my helmet and cycling kits. In any color, the Radarlock XL has got to be the best pair of cycling sunglasses you can buy.\", 7431: 'Much as I hate to spend this kind of cash on such an easily lost or damaged item, these are worth the money for my purposes.

I get several compliments and they definitely keep the light out well.  My only concern was that they would slide down on the bridge of my nose since I have a problem with that, but even though there are no plastic inserts the surface area / coefficient of friction is designed such that its not a problem, even with mild to moderate prespiration.

I have literally taken sidewalk to the face (from a bike) and honestly believe had I been wearing a lesser pair of sunglasses, I'd be in very bad shape. They walked away with 2 completely thrashed lenses (not broken) and barely a scratch on the frames. I was less fortunate. I'm still not sure how I feel about the purple tint. They're quite dark and can make certain low light situations seem dimmer than they should be. That's no fault of Oakley's, just my personal opinion. I prefer the polarized gold in my now deceased Shaun White's for an &#34;all the time&#34; lens, especially driving.\", 7456: \"What can I say, its a bag. Is good for goggles and gloves.

This doesn't bother me. I really like the bra. It fits well. The cut allows it to be worn out and make your lady lumps look good - cleavage even, without looking smooshed to death. Which is a huge plus for me. Also, the colors are fantastic and the bra is super cute. I'd recommend it, and will probably get another! I've been spending upwards of $50 on sports bras for my 38D chest, and the Oakley ones are quickly winning me over - and the price point is much better! I'm a happy shopper.\", 7462: \"I bought this item and it's fantastic, the delivery was fantastic came here right on schedule, it fit as I expected. I'd recommend this product to anyone.\", 7463: \"I own a pair of these glasses bought here on Amazon. The frames get loose around the lens due to the mechanics that allow the switching of lens, so when i put them on i usually need to to squeeze the frame together. The glasses them self are a steal for the price i see them listed at right now on 12/17/13. For under a 150 a great buy! The Polorized lens really help on the water and road. The frames them self are comfortable on the face a nose and ears. Rock these Oakley's on the Mtn this winter!!\", 7464: 'These sunglasses will not disappoint! The fit and finish are excellent. The polarized lenses are beautiful and very effective, especially in a bright sunny environment which is full of glare. Worth the extra price.', 7465: 'These sunglasses fell just short of a WOW response. They look a bit masculine for those who normally choose ultra feminine clothes and accessories. But, if you are primarily concerned about the quality of sun protection, they are excellent.', 7466: 'I like this shirt because it is comfortable, soft and easy to care for.  I would recommend it to anyone.', 7467: 'keeps you warm and is easy to pack. Wore it at the super bowl and it worked out perfect. thanks again', 7468: 'I have been looking and looking for bra style bathing suit tops for a while (without costing an arm and a leg).  I am a little bigger than a D so I had a little bit extra but all in all if you are truly a D this top will be perfect for you.', 7469: \"The medium D was more like a C. I returned it and bought the large and extra large D. The large fit PERFECT!!! It is comfortable and secure enough that it won't gap when wearing it. I went back online to see if I could find it in green, orange and pink but much to my dismay they didn't have any in my size.\", 7470: \"Fast delivery.  Great size for women.  Love the clarity, light weight and easy to clean.  I would buy Oakley's in the future.\", 7471: 'Love my new sunglasses!  They look great and i am supporting breast cancer awareness.  How great is that!  Go pink.', 7472: \"Wait until you watch your wife unwrap these for a present. The gleaming lenses, the immaculate moldings and the sophisticated athletic design, it's sure to make her happy! Look, I used to buy the made in China stuff, but if you have a little disposable income, these are well worth it. We only get Oakleys now. My wife's previous pair lasted her two years -- they had a white frame and with all the running she does, she insisted on a new pair. Yes, I suppose they have started to look a little weathered, but who is really looking? She is, they're right on her nose. This darker set might not get as visibly stained over the coming years, most of the glossy plastic will repel everything except sand and sharp stuff scratching it. Take good care of them, and they will last.\", 7473: \"Love Oakleys! This is my 3rd pair, my last ones are 9 yrs old, so their product is durable! They look just like the picture- I love the wrap around, that's what I've been looking for. The only thing I'm not huge fan of; the lenses are lighter than I'm used to so I still find myself squinting a little on sunny days.\", 7474: 'Snug but awesome I like them but they are a little snug in the leg and no I am not fat.', 7475: \"Great material I would definitely purchase another color! The length of the shirt is good I washe it and it didn't shrink!\", 7476: \"My boyfriends 2nd pair and he loves them. Great style and you can buy the o's still at the oakley website to switch up the style.\", 7477: 'the fabric of the shirt is a good qualityand the sizing fits well. overall a very good shirtbut my only complaint is that there is an Oakley logo on the back of the t-shirt', 7478: \"Super cute.

I love these!', 7480: 'highly recommend this product.am longtime fan of  frogskins.can be sure they are the geniune oakley frogskins.love the way they fit.very pleased with the colour of frames.for safety and all  round purpose are hard to beat.sit very snug on top of head also when not needed.another bonus.', 7481: 'i have a bad habit of losing my Oakley glass, and this style is no longer sold in a lot of stores, likely i was able to find this pair =)', 7482: 'Great shades.', 7483: 'Awesome, love the mirrored lenses, very high quality.', 7484: 'Looks great but the lenses are partly see through overall the glasses are worth the price but might want to look into polarized lenses', 7485: \"First off they look awesome,  they're very comfortable. and offer very good protection. The polarized lenses make everything look Crystall clear with minimal glare.\", 7486: \"I had an issue with the seller, returned it and I got a refund. However, I could wear these shades for some seconds and my wife too. They have been made for women... based on its color and my opinion. They are wider and larger than the Antix ones and very well made. That's why I finally purchased a 24K iridium pair of Offshoots for me... and now I look like a rapper, but just once a week!.\", 7487: 'Awesome glasses, very comfortable, oakleys durable design. If you are looking for some new oakleys, I would definitely recommend these!', 7488: \"Perfect i love the item, fits me perfectly too. I just wonder if there's still warranty for this sunnys, but still loved it tho\", 7489: \"I bought this at an official Oakley store and they look better and sharper in person -- the online photo does not do it justice.  Before going to the Oakley store I had seen the photo of these shades online, but wasn't 100% sure if I would like them.  When I saw them in person, I instantly knew I had to get them.  The frame's colors look more vibrant than the online photo (online photo makes the colors in the frame look kind of &#34;dull&#34;), and the frame looks more glossy in person than in the online photo.  Highly recommend these sharp shades!\", 7490: \"I've been looking for affordable, casual slim fit shirts for awhile now. These shirts fit the bill. It looks and feels nice, isn't tight around the shoulders, and isn't ridiculously long. Good shirt for those with V tapers.\", 7491: \"comfortable to wear and the lens doesn't change the color of the surroundings, just tones down the brightness perfectly.  Great pair of glasses\", 7492: \"The saying written on the front of the shirt doesn't make much sense but the shirt it self is GREAT.  Would love to buy more shirts by this manufacturer.\", 7493: \"Nothing too special, it's a shirt and its comfortable....if you like comfortable shirts that have images on them this may be for you.\", 7494: \"The shirt is awesome in person. I didn't know each shirt was unique, due to the manufacturing process! No two shirts will ever be the same.The design is cool, the shirt fit as expected, and it's an awesome lightweight T-shirt\", 7495: 'Great looking bag.  Saw this bag while I was on vacation and had to have it.  Big enough to fit all my clothes for a weeks vacation.', 7496: \"Looks so much better in real life!  The photo just doesn't do it justice. The rolling action is very smooth.  I am very happy with the purchase.\", 7497: 'traditional, simple, but very nice looking cap, as almost all trucker caps , fits great and is perfect for driving or a warm day.', 7498: 'Price was right, bag is perfect for my needs.  Like the padded strap and carry handle, lots of pockets and lightweight.', 7499: \"This is the ideal bag for storing and protecting your laptop while you're out and about. It has a solid feel and is well constructed. The handle is thick and well attached. Good padding all around with a nice padded sleeve for your computer or tablet attached inside. There is a small zippered bag inside, perfect for keeping cables organized. Lots of space for files or magazines. Zippered front pocket area for accessories. Comes with a shoulder strap that is adjustable and comfortable. All in all, the perfect bag.\", 7500: 'My husband finally got rid of his backpack when I bought this for him.

You will love it!', 7504: 'Everything is perfect, except for the handle it, too hard, very uncomfortable.', 7505: \"It's good\", 7506: \"The only thing I'd change about this back pack is to make the opening for the laptop about 3/4&#34; bigger.  It's very snug getting my dell 15&#34; in and out, if you aren't completely square with the opening it will snag.  Otherwise it was a great purchase.\", 7507: \"I Travel alot,and this bag is Durable good quality. It's Big without being too bulky.

The pocket set up is amazing. I also like the durability of the material', 7510: \"Almost didn't get this bag because of another review but I'm glad I did.  Bag is big enough for my needs with a 17.4 inch HP Envy being used with it.  It has several exterior pockets nothing large for a power supply but good enough for me.One thing you do not notice from the pictures is there is a handle for the bag. It's woven into the lid of bag. You probable wouldn't carry the bag that way but it very convenient to use when handling the bag.The interior is spacious enough for me to include a spare battery and power supply. There is even a couple pen holders.This is my 3rd Oakley bag and for the money I think it is worth it since most laptop bags this size  tend to look the same in black or you have to go with  backpack.\", 7511: \"This bag is a nice change from the typical soft-leather briefcases that so many people have. It's a pretty efficiently designed bag: It is big enough to hold you laptop, some folders and paperwork, some pens and other items, and that's about it. It does not have 50 extra pockets or a thousand zippers like some bags do. It has 3 neat paperwork dividers inside, as well as the main pocket, and two small zipper pockets on the outside of the lid. The magnetic shut feature on the lid is excellent. I wanted to downsize from the bulky North Face messenger bag I had been using (way too many pockets, sleeves, compartments, zippers, straps, etc), and this Oakley bag is a nice change. It also looks very good and seems to be incredibly durable. The lid and the base of the bag are made of rubbery type of material (not leather, as it may appear in the picture). I like this synthetic much better than I would the leather anyway. It will definitely keep things inside the bag dry and safe.My only criticism is that you are limited to carrying it via the shoulder strap; it does not have a handle on the lid. It also doesn't have a strap or sleeve to attached to a rolling suitcase.. And as much as I'm praising it for being simple and without tons of unnecessary extras, I find myself wishing for maybe one more medium size pocket for things that aren't paperwork or folders; There's no obvious spot to put things such as your wallet, keys, or phone in unless you just shove them into the main pocket with everything else. All in all I like this bag. It's a 4/5 though, not quite a 5.\", 7512: \"Thank you for your prompt delivery, this is a good product hold everything I need for my travel, I don't have to dig in my purse to get my stuff.

Knew exactly what I was getting. These glasses are a must for out door actives.

They seem to be pretty durable. I like the styles and colors, the only problem I have is the prices are a little high even on amazon and ebay and they are less expensive there then retail. One word&#34;plastic&#34;! FYI, all Oakley sunglass parts are made in USA(acc mace in china), if they do not say made in America then they were assembled in Italy, and if you buy asain style just call Oakley and say your nose piece is bad, and they will send non Asian style nose pieces for free(if in stock).Oakley in CA told me that. I'm a veteran and I like supporting US products but the prices are driving me away\", 7519: \"These monster dogs are awesome!  They fit great n look good.

Comfortable and reasonably priced.', 7528: \"They fit well. Almost every pair of sunglasses ive used hurt behind my ears, these weren't too bad and ive gotten used to them. No pain. The stock lenses are a bit light so I did replace them with polarized lenses. The swap was easy. Happy with them.\", 7529: 'very nice classic modern shirt! warm enough by its own , it wears little bit large so get one size smaller unless you like the way it look as a jacket !', 7530: 'Exactly what we wanted...we were glad to find them as they are a discontinued style and my husbands favorites.  Thanks for getting them to us so quickly', 7531: 'had them for a while now. They are definitely real and they are made of great material. I bought a separate set of lens that I did not like nearly as much as the ones that came with the frames.', 7532: \"I bought these for my daughter who plays tennis. Really nice pair of sunglasses with good sun protection. When running the sunglasses may still slip a little so I'm going to buy a strap to hold it on. I got from Fresh Shades in the original box and new condition. Nice service.\", 7533: 'Absolutely love the design and look of this backpack that truly catches the attention of everyone wherever I go. Loved the added T-Shirt as well.', 7534: \"I got a pair a few years ago and loved them. Heavy duty wraparound frame for medium/large faces with a great look, these are the best pair of sunglasses I have ever owned. Unfortunately, over time, they got a little bent out of shape and the tip of the arm (the part that wraps around your ears), which is metal, began to scratch the interior of one of the lenses when they were folded up. I got a pair of replacement lenses and tried to be more careful but it happened again. I just ordered another pair (the C-Wire) with rubber arms all the way to the tips so this problem won't re-occur.\", 7535: \"For the past several years I have worn Quicksilver Flip-Flops. After one of them broke recently, I thought I would look for something a little more comfortable. These certainly fit the bill.The padding on these is fantastic. They are very soft and don't hurt my feet at all.As with all flip flops I bought a size up from my normal size, and that is recommended for sure. The size 12 fit spot on, and I normally wear a size 11 shoe. They may be just a bit small, but they will most likely wear in like all of them do and expand a little. They look very nice and they seem very well made.I was a little worried that the straps would be too wide and look more like a fat sandal, but they aren't. They are kind of in the middle of the skinny strap and wide strap, so they work fine.I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these again. I am considering going ahead and getting a backup pair just in case.\", 7536: 'Great arch support!', 7537: 'excellent product, it is so nice. I am so glad with this purchase and of course i recommend these glasses', 7538: \"Light, comfortable and it fits small faces well.

The price was right too!  I would definitely recommend buying from Amazon.', 7543: 'I wanted some aviator style sunglasses, but my face is not quite right for the more traditional aviators.

Love the fact that the stems can be switch about and its so easy to do yet really solid. Great buy!', 7545: 'I broke my last set and was glad to see these still available. I wear these everywhere.

I went from a $20.00 walgreens pair to these and wow what a difference. A great investment to avoid eyestrain and headaches. Also a good investment to protect long term vision.', 7550: 'I use them for travel, very light and quick drying. I work out and run in them. the side pocket is a pain to open but that is by design for swimming. the lack of hole in the front is a little pain you have to untie the strap. Otherwise great shorts. very comfortable.', 7551: 'These board shorts are incredibly comfortable and look really nice too.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for ladies polarized glasses.Thanks amazon!', 7558: \"I lost my previous Oakley glasses (again!) - the Radar model - and they were the BEST glasses ever. Although these are great, too.  Radar are sporty and mostly marketed to men; I thought it would be nice to try something a little more feminine.  For sporty endeavors, I do miss my Radars though.  They wrap around on the sides - so they protect you a little better from sun rays coming in from the sides. But for every day use, these ones are great.I can't imagine ever again wearing any sunglasses other than Oakleys.  Great quality.  Sibylle\", 7559: \"My order said I was supposed to get grey polorized lenses. But the one that came in the glasses were purple... Fortunately my wife likes them so I guess it's ok.

Blending the all-day comfort of lightweight O Matter frame material with Unobtainium components for a secure fit, LBD has a look that lets you indulge in retro glam. The semi-rectangular lenses offer extra coverage to protect your eyes, and the shape was inspired by the era when exotic locales were the playgrounds of glamorous leading ladies.', 7561: 'Finally found sunglasses that sporty/classy and polarized.  I love to go fishing and need polarized sunglasses but would like to still have a sense of femininity.', 7562: \"I love these sunglasses.  I had another pair of Oakley's that were ruined and replaced them with these.  They were a little more than I would like to spend, but they look great and are really, really, comfortable.  They're worth the money in my opinion.\", 7563: 'Love these. Actually bought them for my husband, who has a small face, and the fit perfectly! Very stylish and sleek', 7564: \"Excellent glasses.  I've been wearing Maui Jims (which I also like), and tried these on when I was shopping with someone else.  The difference was immediately obvious.  They got tested on several bikes and quad bike rides out in the desert (the things you do for an amazon review....) and they were perfect.  The polarized treatment really makes a difference.  The grip was tight.  It says on the box that the lens are RXable....  They are a little bit heavier than plastic frames, but because they do not go around your ear you probably won't notice that.  (I actually prefer it.)  The only thing I will say is that when you buy them in person they come with a case;  online they did not. By the way, I wasn't rushing to spend this much on glasses.  However, I figure that I wear them almost every day, and well, eyes are kind of important.  I don't regret the investment.\", 7565: \"I've never seen these in store for less than $240 - $250. At $190, these were a great deal. Brand new, in box.\", 7566: \"I purchased these in a store to get the case which you don't when purchasing online.  I own a few other Oakley models and these grip the head and stay-on when I sweat better than other models.  They also provide excellent optics with no noticeable optical occlusions or wave patterns in the plastic lenses like with some other brands.  The plastic lenses hold-up to bike riding and work well under a bike helmet because the temples are thin and small.  I don't like that these are made in China as most Oakleys are made in the US, but am not downgrading because of this.  Just know this before you purchase if country of origin is important to your purchasing decision.\", 7567: \"Had to replace my previous sunglasses before a major road trip so I bought these off amazon. These were a great choice, they fit my face well and the quality is fantastic.The ice iridium lenses are a LOT more blue than the photo on amazon shows, but I went to oakley's website first and saw how blue they would be.So far these are my favorite oakleys I've ever owned.\", 7568: 'I tried these on at an Oakley Vault store prior to purchasing on Amazon (free $30 Amazon gift card promotion at the time).

They are very handsome and now his friends want to know 'where to get them'.\", 7574: 'I shoot,fish, and ride road bikes.

After 2 years of use, they've gotten a few small scratches, but don't impair vision at all. The only downside is that I have been called Neo a few times while wearing these. I don't worry about it, they're just jealous! I get compliments all the time!\", 7576: \"I have always been a fan of Ray-Ban sunglasses, but my last two pair - Aviator and Predator 2 - didn't seem to hold up as well as I would have liked. I was searching for a replacement when I happened upon the Oakley OO4060-10 Crosshair 2012. In my opinion, these are the best &#34;Aviator&#34; style sunglasses I have ever worn. They are a perfect marriage of the classic Aviator style with modern construction and materials. The lenses provide the sharpest visual clarity I have experienced in a pair of sunglasses, and the fit and comfort are also top-notch. If you are considering Aviator-style sunglasses, you owe it to yourself to try these!\", 7577: \"These are great sunglasses that are worth every penny. I have a large head/face so I have a hard time finding sunglasses that fit me properly and these do. I only have one nit-pick about them. The polished frames get slippery when my temples sweat, causing the glasses to slide off my face at times. I really wish Oakley offered the Polarized Oil Rig in a matte frame or even an ear sock kit for the Oil Rig because I think it would solve this issue. I guess I'll have to save my pennies to buy a custom pair someday.\", 7578: 'Perfect fit, just as it was in the description. Price was reasonable compared to other sites and came as expected.

Only thing is that the lenses scratch easily! Then are really good quality for the price!\", 7582: \"I have to admit I'm an Oakley fan.  I've bought Ray Ban, Maui Jim and other premium brands and been disappointed with durability, but Oakley has never let me down.My initial impressions of these sunglasses is that they're lightweight, well constructed, and very comfortable.  If the lenses hold up as well as all my other Oakleys, then I expect them to be scratch resistant and durable.\", 7583: \"5'6 120 and the medium fits well. It doesn't pinch me in the back if you know what I mean (no muffintop). And good booty coverage. The top cup size runs a little small....I'm a 34b and the medium leaves a little side boob which is fine but I chose the cross back design so I could play volleyball and jump around and not expose myself...so I will only wear this combo for light activity:)\", 7584: 'very comfortable not remove hahaha I love them really love others as I hope to have these soonthanks !', 7585: \"My husband loves these sunglasses.

Some may even say these are youth glasses. So once you decide that these are your size, you will not be disappointed. Lenses are clear, sharp and high quality. Frames fit beautifully and the white/red is just plain cool.......\", 7587: \"I haven't worn Oakley glasses for a couple years but got some Oakley ski goggles last winter and liked them.  The Bottle Rocket's were on offer at prices competitive with bike shop's generic offerings so I took a shot.  I don't give many 5 star ratings but these glasses are as good as it gets on the bike.  Another review complained about the lens size.  I tend to get size large everything but I found these to provide full coverage and great wind protection.  The shape and fit combine to bring the lenses close enough to my eyes to render the frame invisible.

I clarified with the seller regarding the lack of an official oakley paper box, and was informed (very promptly and politely) that it's an overstock product which did not come with a box. The product is certified authentic by Amazon, hence I had no reason to doubt their claim.Regarding this particular model of prescription glasses, the quality seems to be lower than other Oakley products that I have previously used. The red rubber grips (while soft and hugging) are a tad translucent. It's not clear on the photographs, but the frame's black and red coating are bright, rather than matte. While that's not a defect, more a matter of preference, just thought I'll clarify it for any other potential buyer.\", 7657: \"These frames look pretty cool. I really like the color scheme (red/black) and I am partial to titanium. The frame is a bit wide. Maybe that's why they call them &#34;Wingspan&#34;? It's not unusual looking or anything but if you are used to frames fitting flush to the sides of your head, you may be a little surprised to have a little space in that area. At first they fit very crooked but I adjusted the little pad things and got it just right (most people probably know this but just in case not, I mention it). One thing I am curious about is why the lens advertise &#34;Ducati&#34;. I am at a loss as to what Ducati has to do with Oakley, or eyeglasses for that matter. The only real problem I am experiencing with these frames is irritation behind the ears. Although these frames are slightly wide (on me at least), I feel slight pain from the pressure of the arms. I'm hoping overtime I just get used to this but it really is quite annoying and the main reason I drop one star. This issue aside, I am quite happy with these frames.\", 7658: 'Usual oakley quality. Look good, very comfortable. They are an improvement on my last pair. They are brilliant value for money.', 7659: 'This is the greatest pair of sunglasses I have ever owned.

Small Oakley sunglass container shipped in another with 4x more room.

I had another Oakley bikini, so I felt pretty confident buying this online. My only comment would be that a purchaser should beware that the pink is brighter than the colour of the photo. Hot pink.

If you don't have a pair of Razor Blades and you drool for 80's, early 90's nostalgia you might want to scoop a pair of these classics before they are donezo.\", 7672: 'Cool carabiner, but the price is definitely too high. only bought to replace one id had for years, if not for that i would have gone to home depot bought a regular carabiner for $1.35. i paid extra to avoid change. go figure.', 7673: 'Great! Stylish , and looks good on me... I like the size, because it covers my, full face , from the sun..', 7674: 'Great build quality, comfy, i think a bit tight on my head but looks good nevertheless, its more of an elegant look than my other oakleys, so its nice for workdays where i need to wear a suit or have important meetings, locking mechanism is great as has zero play on it..', 7675: \"While I didn't purchase these from Amazon (bought at Oakley Store in Austin), I felt compelled to write a review.These glasses are simply awesome!! The style coupled with many of the new features (Cam Hinges and Air Filled Nose Cushions) make them incredibly comfortable.  The fit is simply perfect!!In the past, I have lost a few pairs of Oakley due to the hinge failing.  Oakley has fixed this problem by eliminating the screws and using a cam-style hinge.  Time will tell if they really do last longer, but they definitely feel more substantial and secure.Build quality is amazing.  Finish on both frames and lenses is perfect.I noticed a lot of pinkness when looking at an IPhone screen due to the polarization in the lenses but my HTC One M8 looked just fine.Registered the glasses on Oakley website for a free one year warranty extension, so now they have two year replacement warranty which is much better than any other brand.\", 7676: \"First off, they fit great. They feel perfect on my head. I love the bag and the oakley case they come with. I  don't like how the rubber on the ends pulls at my hair as I take them off, but most oakleys have these thick rubber grips and it's not this particular glasses fault. I just don't find the grips necessary since they are perfectly snug on me, but I bet anyone with a smaller head would appreciate them. I kinda don't like how people can see me eyes through the lenses but that's just the type of lens I chose.  Overall very high quality glasses, but I wouldn't pay 250 for them again. Probably more of a 180 dollar pair.\", 7677: 'Been an Oakley fan for years. Wife found these and bought them for me and I LOVE them. VERY sexy, comfortable and light weight.', 7678: 'I will also write a review reassuring anyone looking to buy these shades.First and foremost, Oakley is the one selling these through amazon, and they aren\\'t going to let some fake glasses ruin their rep, so rest assured they (Oakley) are selling a genuine product here.Secondly, I personally tried these exact glasses on in an official Oakley store in Las Vegas, NV. Several brand reps from that Oakley store told me these glasses hadn\\'t hit most of the US stores, and were originally released by Oakley in Asia since the \"LX\" for both the frog skins and Holbrooks are an asian fit. Andlastly, Oakley has Holbrook LX\\'s on their website at [...]So don\\'t be dissuaded by an uninformed reviewer, these are top of the line glasses straight from Oakley and you will love them!', 7679: \"That first reviewer was grossly misinformed by his &#34;professional.&#34; These are the new Holbrook LX and like the Frogskin LX, the frame material is acetate instead of Oakley's regular OMatter. No facility in the US is equipped to produce acetate like this for this type of specialized product in any cost effective manner. The reason for acetate is that you can produce richer and more bold designs and color schemes that are just not possible using the composite plastic material that OMatter is comprised of. Hence the new banded green, smoke and olive satin and multiple tortoise colors that were released by Oakley May 1 of this year.Further, this isn't anything new. Frogskin LX came out last year and Oakley has been using materials from overseas in many of their wire frames for a long time because it is the only way to do it. Their lenses are all still made in the USA as well as most of their other eyewear, but even many of the women's models are being produced in Italy now. R&D; still designs everything at 1 Icon in CA, but newer - and in my opinion - overbearing policies on commerce and how goods are ultimately assembled and produced have forced many American made companies to leave off the Made in USA moniker if even a hinge screw in a pair of glasses comes from another country.So, in conclusion I doubt these are not fake, the first reviewer is just incredibly quick to give a misinformed review on a company without finding out the easy to research facts. I work in the industry and have never dealt or worked for whatever company is selling these glasses, but just needed to appease all others that see that first review. I highly doubt that a counterfeit company would counterfeit 1 month old acetate Oakley sunglasses and sell them as a USA store which can probably be confirmed very easily. The cost is too high and the venue is too big to do something that dumb. Oakley's online policy is extremely strict and this would be dealt with swiftly. I own all of these Holbrook models and they are awesome. I like them better than my conventional Holbrooks. They have a little larger fit just by a hair but the new color schemes look sweet so buy with confidence amazonians.\", 7680: 'Awesome deal!', 7681: 'I have tried several Oakley styles and never felt like they looked good on me. This one is perfect! Stylish, feminine,lightweight. Love it!', 7682: 'These are exactly what I wanted for my Birthday. The function of blocked UV rays is perfect. I work outdoors so I need to protect my eyes. In addition they are very stylish and I get compliments. What more could I ask for.', 7683: 'I look like a player when I wear these.... Seriously these will make you look like a badass.... Word, word.', 7684: \"I was at an Oakley store in the mall minding my own business, searching for a pair of Oakley shorts. I did not intend on looking at the glasses because they were too expensive for me at the time. An employee walks up to me and convinces me to try on a few pairs. My head is large so sunglasses don't generally fit me and the first couple of pairs didn't. That was until he put these bad boys on my head. Whoa! They fit perfectly, felt amazing and looked awesome! I told him I couldn't afford the high price tag and left.Days later I couldn't get the pair out of my head. I started saving my money and a month later I purchased the pair online. Yes, I could have purchased a new iPod....or a new Wii U....but these glasses were just too perfect; and they still are. They make me want to go outside and soak-in the 95 degree heat. I'm very happy with the purchase.\", 7685: \"First off: the optics are amazing.  I have a pair of Ray-Ban polarized aviators and even though the glasses have very different usage I prefer the optics from these over the aviator's.Second: I mostly wear these cycling, both road and mountain.  The lack of a bottom frame adds comfort and no breaks in field of view.  I had the black polarized iridium lenses in and one day I took a hard fall onto granite, the lens got dented badly but it did not break and protected my eyeball - I would have very likely lost my eye if it were not for these lenses.But unfortunately, there was a problem with the iridium coating on them.  I only used the Oakley lens cleaning kit, but for some reason the iridium was rubbing off.  It worked to my advantage because Oakley replaced the lenses for free after smashing them because of the defect with the iridium, but it's something to watch out for if you chose the version with that particular coating.\", 7686: 'Great glasses for cycling, driving, or pretty much any outdoor sport. Durable, fantastic lenses, nothing bad I can say about em.', 7687: 'These are an amazing, sturdy pair of sunglasses. Created for the slightly larger heads, but it fits snugly and keeps out all UV rays.', 7688: \"They look great on my husband . I received in time for Father's Day . And he loved them.

Had no issues and comes complete as from the factory.', 7692: 'This backpack has the uberknown badass Oakley looks, plus is far roomier than might appear at first glance.

The clip is solid and unless you are really trying to break it, it won't let you down. As for the rest of the lanyard, the fabric is the typical durable. I love the design.

Shoes are so confortable in any moment. This color is excelent. I need more. Great!', 7700: 'I am a long time patron of the brand Oakley.

Although these were advertised blue frame/grey lens, they are really a matte black w/ grey frme.

If your gonna hide the original label, do a better a job. Plus it was obvious that the case was not medium. If you wanna get ripped off, go ahead and buy from them.

That said: Is it just me, or did someone at Oakley completely miss the point? They should NOT have jammed another limited-purpose MP3 player into a place it didn't belong.Instead, on seeing the ads & marketting, I was hoping they'd have made nothing more/less than a Bluetooth headset integrated with their shades, paired with a small transmitter to attach to whatever MP3 device people already had. Throw your Zen or iPod into your pocket/armband/whatever, and then go. That way, Oakley would have stayed above the format/platform bickering and brought a truly innovative product to market that ALL MP3 listeners could benefit from. Hard-drive jukeboxes, flash-based USB-keys, PSP's and GameBoys, ANYTHING with a headphone jack could have been serviced by this product...\", 4: \"If cool points are where it's at for you, this is your chance. Coolest thing on the market today, no one else has them and a clever design. Three stars for cool.No points for cost. Too high and here's why. The speaker quality is poor. Buy an iPod mini and a pair of Bang & Olufsen earbuds for about the same price and you have much more music storage and sound quality that respects the $500 price range. Oakley must be kidding, people who pay that much for personal sound devices know good sound. These headphones are a little tinny and thin.Another problem is the earbud adjustment. When you do get them adjusted, to where they sound and feel right, don't move your head. They will click out of place allowing outside noise to intrude and lessen your listening experience.  A flexible cord with more ear friendly earbuds would have overcome this oversight. Even changable headphones, which allow you to use your own would be great.Last challenge are the lenses. Oakley makes a great lens. I have been using them for years and have always enjoyed their product. One of their strong selling features is interchangability. Well, not on these. Perhaps in the future. So don't ride or run in the shadows. You'll lose your visual acumen for awhile.\", 5: \"Received the case and it wouldn't shut correctly.

Also, if by any reason you seat on the case (like in you car for example) the case looses the form, and it will not close/open normally unless you try to mold the metal back to it's original position.So, the are okay but personally I will stick to my Soft Vault for being more reliable and durable.\", 11: \"I bought it for my Oakley Plaintiff sunglasses and fits perfectly, that's why I give 2 stars, but it came all scratched, like if it's being used and it was sold as new.

I can only fit the case in my largest backpack, so that's the only time I use it, and only for long trips.

My single most irritating issues is that they don't offer DOD civilians working in war zones any significant discounted prices. Many fine companies do and many (including Starbucks) offer free product. Yes, Oakley offers a military line at a discount, but they are far inferior to the consumer brands, so they aren't offering the military and their support any value.

In addition, the arm of these glasses is a bit too wide and if you intend to wear them quite often under the sun, you have to count with a thick white stripe above your ear up to yor eye.

First of all the price is ridiculous for a pair of shades that do not have glass lenses. Second all the reviews on here about the creaking arms and oil marks on the frame are true. When I first got them I thought I scored as they did not creak at all, well give them a week or two and there it is. And finally the one thing that really sucked about this pair I bought is that after about a month the coating on the outside of the left lens started coming off, creating this large blurry spot... WTF. These shades have now been thrown in the glove box of my truck and used for only river floating shades where I hope to loose them soon and forget how much I spent on such a cheaply made pair of shades. I've bought FOakleys in Mexico with better quality. I'm going back to Bolle's, they have never let me down.\", 59: \"The Silver O on my Matte Black Gascan's keeps falling out. Usually I could grab it and put it back in and it'd stay for a while. Once it fell and I couldn't find it I was frustrated enough to call Oakley and see about getting them fixed. I won these at a charity golf tournament and didn't have a receipt. I am well within the 1 year warranty period, but since I do not have the receipt from the person who bought them, they want $50 to fix the O! There was also a &15 shipping charge which they offered to waive as a 'convenience'.I understand that there are people out there trying to take advantage of a company/business, but I'm just trying to get a replacement O. I'd even glue it in myself.This experience has soured me on Oakley as a whole. I have apparel, golf bags, backpacks and other sunglasses. I will start looking at other brands for those products from now on as a result of their poor customer service and gouging.\", 60: 'The gascan sunglasses are ok but not impressive, the main problem is when you are hot the glasses present fog in the lents and you can not see very well', 61: \"I am very mixed on this product.  The frames and lenses are superior quality, but the style and comfort were lacking.  They look great on the shelf, but they look like old man glasses in some respects.  The ear rests are almost sharp and are made of O material and started to hurt on long drives or extended wear.  The polarized lenses do wonders for relieving eye fatigue when driving on sunny days.  The shape of the frame blocks out the sun from the side so you don't have to worry about side shades when the sun is coming in your side window.\", 62: \"More like garbage can sunglasses. Hurt my ears, hurt my nose and they don't sit straight. These sunglasses might look good, but they don't feel good. And don't move too fast or they'll fall off.

Not worth trying a third time.', 66: 'I was very shocked to find out that the second pair of glasses I ordered for my son are just as bad.  The gas can oakleys are cheap quality glasses', 67: \"The product itself might be of okay quality (though probably overpriced), but the company and brand are flawed.  They stole a small amount of money from me and had the attitude that I'd be powerless to do anything about it.

I can't say the package has everything that it was suppose to come with so I will be contacting customer service immediately and am unhappy about this whole experience.

If you\\'re an athletic person, you are going to spend a lot of time pushing these glasses back up on your face.

If you try them on and they fit, then you can go back to the Internet and find a decent price.  This was my second pair of Oakley\\'s and I probably will not buy this brand again.

This is contrary to what I see in some reviews stating at the frame is scratch-free even after dropping it.The purchase comes with an Oakley box, a black microfiber bag with white drawstrings and a piece of paper stating the warranty details and care instructions.It's authentic but seems to be an old product as newer production runs of Gascans now have the 'O' logo at the end of the legs.  Mine version doesn't have it.\", 81: \"Nice glasses overall.  i find that the flat black frame tends to show fingerprints and other marks where body oils darken the flat black surface of the frame, this is easily corrected by wiping down the frame.  I tend to get some reflection from the rear but not so much as to adversly affect my forward perception.  Don't know how they will react to wind when riding the motorcycle yet but since they don't wrap very thightly to the face I suspect that they will have some movement while at highway speed.Nice styling.

Upon very close inspection of the lenses, I have noticed that the lenses are still in great condition, it is the \"Iridium\" coating of the lenses that is scratched up really badly.

I will be purchasing some plain polarized lenses without this coating as soon as possible.  Keep clear of these \"Iridium\" lenses if you don\\'t want to be buying new ones for $85 a pop every other week.PREVIOUS REVIEW:I got these glasses for my work outdoors, and they were fantastic for blocking out the bright Arizona sun.  About two weeks in, however, the problems started..The frames to these glasses are fantastic, they hurt a little after a while of wearing them as some others have stated, but it\\'s still manageable.  However, the lenses are incredibly cheap.  About two weeks in to owning this pair of sunglasses, I noticed scratches and scuffs beginning to appear, despite being kept in a hard case at all times that I was not wearing them.  I completely inspected the case and glasses, and there has been no sign of anything that could have made so many scratches!  It is incredibly frustrating to me to think that I spent this much on a pair of sunglasses, and they didn\\'t even hold up two weeks when a cheap pair from Target would have held up for months before a single scratch!  I will not be buying from this company again, nor will I purchase Oakley glasses.  It\\'s a shame, because the lenses were extremely clear, and functioned well before the scratches, but I guess it comes at a cost of being incredibly flimsy and easily scratched.BUYER BEWARE: The lenses are ridiculously easy to damage, please consider this before purchasing them.', 95: \"These glasses are certainly stylish, and I see many people wearing them.  My son wanted a pair so badly he couldn't stand it, so I got lots of work out of him before I ordered these. ;)The glasses seem fine, but I can't help but feel they are overpriced for what you get.  The plastic is very lightweight to the point of feeling flimsy, and despite the description I can't really see anything spectacular about the lenses.They were packaged well and came with a storage bag, but I can't help but feel like I was paying simply for the &#34;Oakley&#34; name.  My son?  He thought they were great for awhile, but got buyer's remorse when he realized how much work he had to put in just for a pair of sunglasses.  The Under Armour field glasses he received for Christmas (also pricey, but a little less than these) were a much better choice for him than the Oakelys.\", 96: \"They sold gascons at $90 good deal saves you about $20 from the store...

Within a few days, we noticed that the coating on the lenses scratches very easily, and after being left on the seat in the pickup for a few hours while at the store, they no longer fit straight. It's like the plastic frame warped. $95 could have bought 4 better pairs of sunglasses. On a good note, we were able to return these for store credit, and purchased a pair of JMartis instead. 1/4 the price and better sunglasses, in my opinion.These are the JMartis we replace the oakley junk with.http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002WNVTP8/?tag=theprescat-20\", 98: \"I have had the glasses since March 21st and had only worn them while driving.

I expect more from Oakley buy they will not stand behind the product because they weren't purchased from an authorized dealer.

Since then, I\\'ve grown privy to all things Amazon, so I researched the highest-rated shades--which were these, the Gascans. At the eye place I tried on the Polished Black style and they looked great, felt great, and were priced decently. I decided to go ahead and order them in Matte from Amazon (cheaper, and plus the eye place didn\\'t have the Mattes in stock), and have them prescribed.A couple weeks later I got the phone call that they were ready. Oh, what a double-bladed day. The eye glasses I ordered was the Oakley Bucket (which I\\'ll review later), which needed to be resized, as did the Gascan. They fell off easily, so a quick re-heating of the arms did the trick, and they were snug. I wore them the rest of the day since I had some errands to run, and they were just marvelous. They blocked out the sun entirely, cushioned my eyes, and were light as a feather, so they didn\\'t really weigh down my skin. At first I thought the weight was a drawback--they felt cheap--but then I realized it\\'s to keep the glasses on all day long.On my way to work the next day, however, I noticed that they were sort of slipping down. \"Odd,\" I thought. \"Did they loosen up over night?\" Worried, I tucked the arms into my hat, which prevented them from falling over. During lunch I purposefully took a walk outside and was struck with horror as the Oakleys would now fall off with even a slight glance downward. I grew frustrated that I paid nearly $140 for the sunglasses and prescription lenses, and they didn\\'t even stay on my head. I wore them a few more days after that with my hat because I just love them otherwise, but I hope that my next visit to the eye place will help bend the arms and nosebridge. The Matte material, though easier on the skin oil (oil still shows, though), makes it easier for the glasses fall/slide off.

I have never had this problem with other glasses before and its why I am forced to take a couple stars off.  This is heavily distracting and it seems the fog will not dissipate on its own unless the glasses are removed for an extended amount of time.Of course, this isnt a constant problem, but has happened every day in multiple environments seconds after putting the glasses on.  It is a problem that hinders my experience and diminishes the quality of these particular glasses on me.  I also understand that not everyone will have this particular problem.

When you wear them you can notice that with your left eye and even though it\\'s not the worst thing it does look like a scratch or smudge. I have gotten used to it though. Still, they shouldn\\'t put that on the lens itself but maybe a stamp or engraved part on the inside of the frame.

I\\'ve tried playing volleyball with them and they stayed perfectly glued to my head.  They fit better and are much lighter than my polarized HalfWire.  They were pretty heavy and were constantly falling off my head so I couldn\\'t do anything active with them (I use them mainly for driving).But using it for work, as described, the transition happens waaaayyy to slow to be of any real use, and even at its best, it doesn\\'t darken nearly enough to make any real difference.  I\\'ve experimented with some ultra-violet flashlights so I know they darken, but again, only in direct sunlight (UV) and very slowly.  Most Luxury cars like mine have UV filters, so it doesn\\'t get activated when I drive.

It is  lined w soft fabric, but there is not a flap of any kind that covered the inside of the zipper competely.I'd glady pay more for a more suitable hard case, this is just ridiculous.My opinion.... do not buy this if you have an expensive watch.Do not expect this to be safe in luggage.

Now some lenses from oakley have the p sticker to indicate polarized, however i did not order polarized and the lenses were not labeled polarized on the bottom right corner of the lenses that everyone knows oakley has, so why was there a \" P \" sticker on my non polarized lenses?Secondly the Oakley labels in the middle of the lenses were clearly different. The lettering was different and on 1 pair there was a trademark r after oakley, and another there was not, just the regular oakley label. Again not sure how this can be if I order 2 identical pairs of Brand New glasses.Third the lenses were very loose on the fake oakley\\'s, you could squeeze the bottom of the lens and the top of the frame and there was tons of movement with the fake oakley\\'s.

Yes, the Amazon description does not say that it comes with two lenses, but it is a poorly veiled excuse.If you are going to remove items from the retail packaging, the price should reflect the value of what remains. The difference between the selling price and the MSRP is much less than what it would cost to replace the missing lens. Sold in retail packaging under the guise of having all retail parts there, but it does not.Bait and switch much? Buyers should beware any time the advertised price is lower than MSRP.

I took them to the Raleigh NC Oakley store (where I had purchased them), they said they could not help as it was over a year since purchase and suggested I call Oakley customer service.I did this, I was basically given the verbal bird, they did not care and wanted $40 just to look at them.I purchased them because I target shoot and Oakley's have a reputation amongst shooters as high quality safety gear.

About 5 months of normal wear,  the side blew out on me.  To make a long story short, Oakley would not replace the boots, because it was past 90 days and instead offered me a 20 dollar coupon.

They are \"sneaker-like\" comfortable and very light but that comes with a tradeoff in durability...and for the price?  Not worth it.  I also found that if you are running on wet surfaces they tend to slip easily.  The soles wear out really quickly, the padding compresses quickly and they aren\\'t made for weather.  Plus, you can\\'t re-sole or refurbish these boots.  If you have the money to burn and only use them for o-courses, occasional humps or once a week use - fine.  If not, get a pair of Danner Acadias.

I got them very quickly and they looked great, were very light and felt like a comfy running shoe when I put them on.  I carried my old boots to the dumpster on my way to work the next morning - BIG mistake.Within just a few hours of wear in an office environment, the sole started separating from the outside edge of the leather on the right boot.  Then from the same place on the left boot.  By day three, the sole had separated on each boot except for the heel and toe and started making farting sounds with each of every step of both feet.  The dumpster had been emptied the first evening and my old boots, with the soles still attached were on their way to the incinerator.I have returned these cheaply made, sorry excuses for &#34;Assault&#34; boots to the vendor, still waiting for my refund.  Oakley, you should be ashamed!  Thousands and thousands of service men and women buy your products to get them through the suck over here and if they could get away with wearing the 99 cent shower shoes they sell at the PX, they'd be better off and get a lot more mileage out of them than this &#34;boot&#34;.\", 189: 'I ordered these boots in December 2010 and the boots are already falling apart.

I will not buy another pair of boots made by Oakley.', 190: 'I bought these boots while on deployment in Afghanistan. I wore them once and they fit fine. A couple of months later, when we were leaving, I put them back on. The soles on both boots started coming off because the company used glue on the soles. Now, the only places the soles are still attached are on the front, where it is sewn on, and on the edge of the heel. These boots are terrible, and I wish I had never bought them. I definitely recommend getting the sewn sole version of this boot. Also, apparently 6&#34; boots are not within regulations for the Army.', 191: \"The outer soles started to detach themselves from the boot within the first two weeks.  And this is just walking around a squadron building with an occasional flight in an airplane.  Just walking around and a couple of sorties pressing on rudder pedals, nothing else.  After one month (I rotated these with three pairs of Bellville boots), there were huge parts of the outer soles that had come unglued.  There is a significant quality control problem wherever these are manufactured.  Either they forgot to apply all of the glue that binds the outer soles onto the boot, or the design is just bad.  Absolutely the worst boot purchase I've ever made.  Don't waste your money!!!!  I replaced these with a pair of Bellville 320s, which is a superior boot in every way.\", 192: 'I did my research before purchasing these boots. I read reviews and watched Youtube videos. All seemed to be favorable. I wore these boots for just under a month and the soles are already fully separated from the upper. I work in the freight industry and do a fair amount of walking, but no hard use. I would not recommend these to anyone in a cold, or wet climate.

They were new but the leather was covered with graphite stains.  I had to clean the boys for half an hour.....I could not return the boots because I needed them now for my work uniform.  Amazon needs to work on their quality control.', 196: \"I bought a pair of Oakley SI assault hiking boots from a shoe boutique in the Haight Ashbury around 2005. I talked the seller down from $300 to about $200ish. One overpriced pair of boots is enough for me.First the good:--Ultra comfy boot.--Quiet.--Aggressive tread carves into any terrain.--The spread of the sole even makes beach walking in shod feet less tiring.--Very good fit.Initially, a wonderful boot experience. A real treat for your feet in any kind of terrain almost.Now the bad:--The tread lugs on the front of the boot wore down way too fast with moderate to heavy use.--I had these boots for weeks before enduring heavy rain in them.The boot interior was nice and dry, but after walking through a shallow but extremely wide puddle on the street one of the boots developed a very loud watery squeak. The watery squeak stuck around ever after--even in dry conditions. Unacceptable for a combat boot to develop a permanent squeak from merely walking through a puddle once.--The interior lining at the heel in both boots wore down to the leather in no time. A few months. There is a lot of padding to wear through and once worn, the shoe doesn't fit right and is blister city. These boots look great and feel great and are practically pristine on the inside and out--with the exception of the heel lining. What good is a perfect boot when I have to take it to a shoe-worker to fix it for me to even wear it, because Oakley couldn't be bothered to do wear testing on their product first?It's not just my pair that fell apart inside like that. If you use a search engine and look for reviews of this boot you will find that the heel wearing through the lining is an endemic problem in this model. Oakley has been making this boot for years. They've changed the tread up a little on recent models and got rid of the stupid glaring red plastic special forces logo on the outside of the shoe awhile back I noticed. They've had tons of feedback about the heel lining over the years and still these boots are made with this flaw which you can read about by other consumers by checking out certain reviews for the 8inch version of this boot.For this boot to have such glaring flaws and to cost more than Danner, Bellevue or Bates boots is completely unacceptable. This is a case where you are very much paying for the Oakley brand name. It's just a shame they couldn't have backed up the price with quality that other boot reputations are made from. I would tell the folks at Oakley that if they wanted a five star boot to make the treads last longer and do something about toughening up the boots interior lining at the heel but they've known for years and they don't listen because it's not cost efficient I guess.Bottom line. A good boot to wear only occasionally, if you want to spread the life of the interior liner. Or, if you can afford to get $40 worth of shoe maintenance done every three months to doctor the heel, then these boots will serve you well for routine duty.\", 197: 'After 3 months of use sole is coming off already just a hopeless boot never buy Oakley boot again never', 198: 'I currently work in Afghanistan in an office enviroment. I do walk outside daily. I have worn these boots for approximately 1.5 weeks and the side of the sole is coming away from the boot.

Oh and the other thing that bothers me is the fact that they are not waterproof uurrgghh!', 205: \"These boots seem durable enough and look great, but the fit seemed a little bit large.  I also didn't understand why the laces were about a foot longer then they needed to be.  I had to constantly tuck them in, which became a hassle.  I feel like the $180+ price tag is way too much for what you get out of these.  I usually love Oakley gear, but felt slightly disappointed with these.\", 206: \"Yes, they are comfortable pair of boots and good pair to show off even if you are just SF-wannabes.  Good for light-duty hiking and daily use.  My friend in the service got me a pair because PX sells Oakley stuff at about 50% off the retail price.  They are not for heavy duty.  I have a desert version.  They are not very breathable after some wear....even indoors. They would be good boots at about $100 at the most.  Black version doesn't even have Gore-Tex materials.  At almost $200, they should.  If you plan to shell out that much cash for a pair of boots, I recommend Danner or Altima.  They'll last you heck of a lot longer and your feet will appreciate 'em.  Danner's desert version has Gore-Tex materials.  For those of you who never had that type of boots, the difference in terms of comfort during extended wear on your feet is night and day.  You can re-sole them as well after wearing out the bottom.  Not possible with Oakley.  Oakley make good products, but some of their pricing just doesn't make sense to me for what the products actually deliver.  But if a cool factor matters more than functions and you don't mind shelling out a few hundred bucks, go for it.\", 207: 'Love the sunglasses, had to pay an extra $30 to get them into the states, did not include certificate for authenticity', 208: \"These are ok for a spare pair.

I am not sure which entity is not an &#8216;authorized dealer&#8217;.  I did contact Oakley but the problem is that they have a 4 day response time and I would like to get this resolved as early as possible so I can determine whether or not to return them. My concerns are: why is Cheap Wholesale Watches not an authorized dealer and why does Amazon use vendors who are not authorized dealers; second are these knock offs and that is why Oakley refused to warrant them?I did try the &#8216;contact us&#8217; on the Amazon but I could not find a suitable link to as to these questions.

This damage also makes the boot rub on the heel and back of my leg. I would not recommend this boots to anyone using these for anything but very light duty use.', 219: 'I like these boots very much. They are probably the most comfortable boots I have worn, However. In February of this year I ordered a pair of boots for work. I started wearing the boots around the end of February, beginning of March. In October, approximately 7 months after I started wearing the boots I noticed a hole had worn in the heal of the left boot. I do not drag my heals when I when I walk.

The rubber over most the treads is blistering.', 220: 'first  front leather is different pairs and its and it is made in china :/ after that i thought my magnum  much better than this ones', 221: 'I used two pair of the Oakley Assault boots for a year long tour in Iraq.  I rotated my boots so wear was distributed.  I used a soft brush after each mission and after a normal duty day.  I kept loose threads trimmed and the ends tacked down to prevent unraveling.  Additionally I aired the boots and inserts out daily.PROS: Very comfortable. I wear a size 9 regular width, but I got the boots in extra wide to allow for foot expansion in the heat.CONS: Rapid tread and thread wear.  My job involved about 50% walking and 50% riding.  I experienced considerable tread wear 4 months into my tour. Threads began working loose about 3 months into my tour.  I replaced the boot laces on each boot twice. By the end of the tour I had bald tread and uppers that had separated.  A local cobbler stitched the uppers together to get me through the last month of my tour.CUSTOMER SERVICE: My experience was YOYO.

Very unnerving when your trying to stay quiet.', 222: 'I bought these boots 4 years ago for work, they were the best boots I had ever worn, very light, comfortable to wear fitted like a glove. but! after 6 months I too noticed in the heal area the lining breaking apart in both boots?

I rang Oakley and they arrange to have them sent back and send me another pair. they said the boots were faulty causing the heal to wear very quickly. good service I thought from Oakley.

Cannot even begin to explain how comfortable these boots are compared to the pair of Bates i was issued. Half the weight and they fit perfectly. Took about 3 and a half months for the tread to wear completely flat in the sand. Still wearing the same pair. If you want something easy on your feet than these are it, just do not expect them to last long if you are going to be abusing them much.', 224: 'Oakley 8\" Assault Boots - TemperateThere are several different Oakley assault boot configurations and it isn\\'t because they\\'re made in different countries. There\\'s a temperate climate boot that does not have stitching all around the outside of the sole, and it is a much warmer boot. It\\'s available in black or desert tan. Then there\\'s the desert boot only available in desert tan. This is made of a lighter material with stitching all around the outer sole.The boots I purchased are the black temperate climate boots made in China. I found that they\\'re sized about one half a size smaller than athletic shoes. I normally wear size 12 sneakers, and I had to step down to size 11.5 with the Oakleys. The leather construction is cheap, as in $30 worth of cheap. It feels like the fake leather they use on cheap belts or wallets, nothing like the leather used on military issued boots.There\\'s a sticky leather used around the inside of the boot neck and at the heel. The heel leather tends to peel off. The rubber used for the sole and around the forward part of the boot is of medium stiffness, but the boot still needs break-in time to feel flexible. The ankle area feels extremely stiff out of the box and Oakley should have gone to an all-Cordura material for flexibility. The soles are still rather thick and don\\'t feel like sneakers. They also make a lot of noise when wet and they also squeak on polished surfaces. The tread compound appears to wear easily.The price of these boots was definitely not commensurate with the manufacturing quality. I\\'ve read numerous complaints from owners regarding the boots falling apart within 6 months and I don\\'t have any reason to doubt these reports.I noticed quite a few movies that had main characters sporting Oakley\\'s latest accessories (backpacks, optics, footwear). Terminator Salvation was one of them. John Connor seemed to show off the Oakleys whenever possible, but in a manner that made it seem like the boots were uncomfortable.Pros: Fairly stylish, soles have decent traction on rough surfaces, feels light weightCons: Still needs break-in time, felt very stiff, still did not feel like running shoes, ankle area was too tight, cheap construction and materials, extremely high price tag - most \"military-spec\" boots are available at a lower costOverall: 2/5 stars, you\\'re paying the price premium for the Oakley brand', 225: \"i had the first SI Assault from Oakley back in 2002, that pair of boots really served me well. So, I decided to get a second one. Guess what? Oakley quality degraded throughout the years. The sole came off only after a few months. I also used to have an e-Wire sunglasses, that was a classic! But when I got to the newer ones, the film of the lens peeled off easily. Same goes with their bags; the handle of their backpack suddenly broke - and worst, the local dealership here in Manila won't even give me a warranty!! After several years of using Oakley, I decided to finally dump the brand and buy no Oakleys anymore.\", 226: 'Deployed to Afghanistan, purchased these boots 2 months ago. The inside heel liner in both boots are ripped out already. I wear the boots mainly on the FOB and on one or two patrols. Very dissapointed, they fit great and are super comfortable.  Now I have to buy a new pair after only 2 months of use!', 227: 'I purchased two pairs of the Oakley Special Forces Elite Special Issue desert combat boots along with the converse Desert boot and tactical research desert boots.  I rotated the boots daily so the liners would stay dry and to reduce smell and the  risk of jungle foot.  I wear the boots for PT and bike rides. At the 60 day mark of wear in Iraq through the end of summer, fall and rainy season of middle Iraq, the heel cup liners on the inside of the Oakley desert combat boots started ripping in both pairs of boots at about the same time.  This eventually (in 4 more wearings each) allowed the foam padding to abraid piling onto my socks and then exposed the hard plastic heel form in the inside of the boot.For the first 58 days, the boots were light, comfortable, looked good and withstood 3x weekly convoys in Cougars and Mraps, walks over the gravel and desert, climbs in and out of broken shells of buildings.  Once the heel liners wore out at day 60 of use, the boots hard plastic heel cup has such a hard sharp edge that the discomfort makes the boots unwearable/unseviceable.The Tactical research boot continues to hold up after 80 days of 12hr/day wear.  There is some peeling to the TR outer heel leather wrap where the stitching has given way (I put my feet under the seat across me in the RG33s and Cougars ( who doesn\\'t?)The Converse desert boot has lasted 2 1/2 months of daily wear. The Converse desert boot has a wide mid-foot last so I recommend it for trial for my soldiers with flat feet that are wide in the middle with the collapsed arch.At over $135/pair and only 60 wear days of life even when rotated between 4 pairs of boots, I will not recommend these Oakley boots to my junior enlisted unless they can afford to order new boots every two months of daily wear.Hopefully Oakley will crack the code on their boot design/manufacturing quality control.I had four pairs of Blackhawk desert wear combat boots.  The boots are great for garrison, light comfortable and you can run in them.  There is a heel cup liner problem with these also but the liner wears out at about the 7 months of (14 months for two pairs changed every other day and limited wear on the weekends and DONSAs, 12hr-day) wear mark before the hard plastic heel cup is exposed making the boots unserviceable.  The plastic toe shield once scratched by  wire, a brick or the metal edges in the MRAPs splits and exposes the inner liner of the toe of the boot that quickly tears and exposes your toes.  A dab of shoe goo will hold about two months on the sidewalks in garrison or about 1 week in the desert.  Another consideration that could be a problem is that the steel mesh shank that supports the arch has two rivets that hold the shank to the sole of the boot.  The shank is too narrow to be protection from punji stakes.  The rivets are inserted souch that as you cycle your foot roll over the sole of the boot, the rivets loosen with edges that \"peel\" up to expose a ragged circular lip that has been cutting through the boot foot insole liner.  Thankfully the toe box failure and the resultant failure of the boots as a whole came before the metal edges bit into the bottom of my foot.  The metal edges stand up about 3mm and the insole of the boot probably collapses to 3.5mm with running or climbing stairs/ladders.', 228: \"I too had some Oakley boots back in 2007-8 and wore them in a regular size and I still have them with the sole worn flat and glue gunned the inside stitching to cover them from rough terrain cuts where most boots usually blow out.  They are comfortable and well broken in to the point of their life's end and I have thrashed them hard.So, I forked up the cash and ordered a new pair of Oakley's in my size this summer to continue the tradition and comfort and rotate them with my other pairs of well broken in boots.  Only, the new Oakley pair I got had way too much padding that heats up your foot and it does not feel like the same Oakley boot system even after breaking them in for 3+ months it fits way too big to the point of me putting another insole on top of the ones inside to take up the extra room and it is still labeled the right size on the boot tongue.  It feels like I am wearing platform shoes!!!!! ------- Not Good!Save your money until Qakley does some quality control - change some management positions - and produce the same boot quality they did back in the past.Belleville 390 Des (cool in desert), Newer Rockies S2V (little hotter in desert)will get my hard earned $$$$$$$ from now on.Spend your money on their Oakley sunglasses and get your boots elsewhere, the sun has set on this product from what it used to be.Pros:Name, Tan, Cushion SoleCons:Too big in size, one size larger than what you order (up a whole size) too much padding that equals heat in a desert / hot environment and sweaty feat where other boots cushion and are cooler.  Not what they used to be in quality control for the cost they are selling them at.  There are other name brand boots that offer better features for a lower price to spend your hard earned money on.Bottom Line:Leave this product to the chicks dig it gear crowd and save your money for some better boots from other manufacturers.\", 229: 'I bought a pair of these boots approximately six months ago for daily use for light to medium duty (Fire/EMS).  While they are hands down the most comfortable pair of boots I have ever worn with virtually no break in time, they are also some of the worst in quality.  The liners at this point are shot and pealing, laces are wearing out, and I had to start applying shoe goop to keep the soles on about two months ago.  The leather is plastic coated and started pealing within the first month.In comparison, I have a pair of Danner TFX assault boots and minus the stains and some sole wear, are just as solid as the day I bought them three years ago.In summary; unless you just want something that looks \"pretty\", save the time, money, and headache and go with Danner.  They are comfortable and light, with a short break in time, and run close to the same price.  Not to mention, Danner\\'s can be resoled.', 230: 'I thought I was ordering the XS Fives.

Flaks are super comfortable, fashionable and great for active people.  They are superb for running, cycling, hiking and whatever other outdoor activity you can think of.  The frames are extremely durable and have survived numerous drops and falls.  The lenses are crystal clear and come in a variety of colors and light-blocking ratings.  They are a quality product.Now the cons.  These glasses come with replaceable nose and ear pads.  This might sound like a good thing, but I have never had a pair of nose pads last longer than a few weeks without falling off.  I never noticed it until I went to put the glasses back on and at that point there was no telling where they had fallen off.  These pad sets cost about $12 which adds up over time.  Also, the lenses WILL scratch no matter how much you baby them.  Replacement lenses run about $60 a pop.  If you keep a pair of Flaks for five years, you will probably end up spending a total of three or four hundred bucks to keep them pristine.  That's a lot of cash for a pari of plastic sunglasses however durable they might be.Because I don't baby my glasses and do not have cash to burn, I now useJiMarti JM22 Triad TR90 Frame Sunglasses with 3 Sets Interchangeable Lenssunglasses which provide equal quality to Oakleys at a fraction of the cost.  The Triad comes with three pair of lenses and a case for one-third the price of Flaks.  Believe me that matters when you're out cycling or running and drop your glasses on the road.There's no doubt that Oakley makes a great product, but for price-conscious people there are better options.\", 233: \"Nice sunglasses except that they didn't fit me well.

The button to start and stop the chronograph should have been labeled \"random\" as that is how the button functioned (or not).  I spoke to Oakley support (that experience worthy of a separate unflattering review) but was finally told I should return to Amazon as sending to Oakley would take 2-3 weeks.  I returned my purchase to Amazon (they were great) and they sent another one out same day.  However, 2nd watch behaved just like the first so it is going back as well.

I had some dust form my friend in front of me and it seems like these glasses attract dirt INTO your eyes. I tested the same scenario without glasses on and I got barely any dust in my face. The main reason that I don't like these glasses is that pretty much just looking at them the scratch. I have had these for less than a week and they are already ruined. You can barely see out of them because of all of the scratches. I have only worn these glasses twice and the seccond time was in a mountain bike race and I had to take them off half way because of the headache they were giving me. You think that for $180 you can get a decent pair of glasses from Oakley.

Frustrating to say the least.As far as the lenses, they are good quality, as good as the originals that came with the glasses.

Now Oakley charges the same amount of money for the lenses and u have to apply the finish to the glasses to which after about 3 cleaning or so it must continually be applied. What a joke! They should have lowered the amount for the cost of the lenses and passed it on to u and I. Anyway, just wanted to let you know the description is false.

What\\'s disturbing is the soles, while very very soft, appear to have plenty of tread, but are in fact wearing through under the ball of the foot, and one is separating along the side of the sole as well.The uppers are in excellent condition, and would give years more service if the soles were thicker/harder/better made.My other wear complaint is the pair of fabric shoelace guides (on the laces between the lower  section and the shaft of the boot) have worn out, but I used a leather punch to create two new holes in the leather for the laces to go through, and that\\'s worked fine so far.Does anyone know if these can be resoled?  Boots like this should last much longer -- the sole is the weakest aspect of the boot, making no better than the cheap hiking boots I\\'ve bought in the past and wear out in a year or two.UPDATE 23 Jan 2014:  I have emailed Oakley\\'s \"customer care\" department twice in the past 3 months about the problems I have with the boots -- including actual photos -- and have never received a response.

However, I doubt I'll buy another pair of shoes online.\", 280: 'I am always puzzled at the fan service paid to Oakley; they charge a very high amount for their products, which in the experience of this buyer, either don\\'t do what they are advertised to do, or break after less than one year.  And, seeing as how Oakley PRIDES themselves on being the top choice for athletes and \"Special Forces around the world\", I\\'m not sure how they keep getting away with it.  Prestige is a powerful thing, I suppose.First off - comfort.  These boots are comfortable, for the first two weeks.  After that, the inner lining of the boot, which is nothing more than upholstered padding, is worn off by contact with the foot.  And this was just from me walking around campus.Second - the fit.  I ordered a size down, and there was still nearly two inches of space for my foot to slide around in.Third - the \"waterproofing\".  Don\\'t be fooled, \"waterproof\" material and \"seam-sealed\" construction will give you a waterproof boot; unfortunately, these boots are lacking the latter.  So, the waterproof material of the boot beads and channels water into the seam of the tongue that is not sealed, and places it directly on your foot.  I stepped in water 3-4\" deep, and it ran into the shoe like I was wearing a pair of crocs.  I find it weird that none of the other reviewers mention this, but they are probably still too busy staring at the \"O\" symbol to ever fathom that something could be wrong.Finally - The price.  I don\\'t really need to extrapolate, if you are going to sell something for this much money, it better perform.  I highly doubt SF teams are deploying wearing these, and if they are, they are having to buy new boots after each rotation, and wrap them in duct tape when encountering water over 10 mm high.Seriously, go buy some Danners or Timberlands, and get what you pay for, instead of feeding the money machine that is Oakley.', 281: \"I had ran these boots over seas so these were fielded pretty hard usage. These boots fell apart a little over 3 months. I was beyond pissed at these boots. I had some old issued boots that had made it through my last deployment and were worn in perfect to the point they fit like a glove. But because they were so beat up looking I was told I should get a better high dollar pair before shipping out. I decided to go with Oakley's only because I love their ballistic glasses which are some of the best money I ever spent. I wish I could say the same for these boots.First I will say comfort is great. These bran new felt a pinch better then my 4 year old worked in military issue boots. Which is one of the main reasons I got these boots. And I cant knock how good I thought they looked. And since they advertise to special forces I figured they do even better for just standard infantry. Well they didn't! The outer material just started to fall apart. Then the soles of the boots started to wear down really fast like the maruaders or jump boots soles seemed too. Then I got them snagged on the front while in a hummer and tore a hole in the boot.In short I do a lot of hunting and hiking in my part time. And I know these boots wouldn't hold up on the usage I put my boots through for those activities. The only place I could see these boots being used in the military is if you sit all day and just want something comfy on your feet. Any usage outside I wouldn't use these boots or count on them at all. I do take great care of my gear and did with these boots over seas and it wasn't care just factory construction that is lacking IMO. There are so many better boots out there for the price even the converse held up for a buddy of mine for 2 deployments and these boots cant even last through one? Oakley needs to take these boots off and do a complete redo. Sad to say but if they did Id prolly get another pair just how much I trust the name Oakley.

The Oakley website claims this case will fit the Tightrope, but I don't see how without bending the glasses, or mutilating the case.  If it was about 1/4 inch wider, everything would be great.I still use the case, but the zipper doesn't completely close, and a small portion of the hinge on the glasses sticks out the side.  This works okay with the way I use the case, but I was disappointed.  If you have a pair of sunglasses that does fit inside, then this case will be great.

Upon discovering this, I called Oakley directly and asked them what a M Frame sunglass would look like out of the box, and what markings would be there.  The customer service representative immediately informed me that in addition to the other size/model markings, Made in USA would appear on ANY genuine M Frame sunglass.  Unbelievable.  Nice try.

Perhaps they will fit in those frames.As described and delivered, I cannot recommend these. Either they are for a slightly different frame or the equipment is not cutting them into the correct shape.

Not as flashy, but very nice and superbly functional.', 328: \"it's a tough bag, visually and structurally. but it's also kinda heavy (even when empty). for over a year and a half, i have used it daily for the gym. it has held up well to the rigors of NYC public transportation (rush hour commuting), being overstuffed with my junk, being stuffed in and yanked out of narrow gym lockers, being thrown onto the floors of various bars and nightclub coat check rooms. definitely a tough bag.i was very happy and looking forward to quite a few more years with this bag... BUT BEWARE: the shoe compartment on the bottom has a zip that frequently gets caught on the inner fabric when zipping. in the year and a half + that i've had the bag, the zip has gotten caught several times. i was always able to work it free eventually... until the most recent snag. couldn't get it free at all and ended up ripping the fabric and the zipper teeth. since i've had the bag so long, there's no warranty. oakley also doesn't have repair service. the bag is essentially useless to me now. major bummer. that's an expensive waste.\", 329: 'I bought this as an everyday bag for college. I must say that the design makes getting to your things a huge pain. You have to lift the top flap and hold it up - it doesn\\'t stay back on it\\'s own and wants to force its way back down. This is very inconvenient. The small flap pocket that holds your pens and pencils on the front is also annoying. You have to open the zipper all the way because it obstructs you from removing anything. The laptop pocket is way too big if you only have a 13\" laptop. The size of this bag is unnecessary for school. It looks kind of ridiculous when you\\'re only carrying 1 or 2 books in it. It looks very flat/deflated unless you put a sweatshirt or something else in it. I would not recommend this as a school bag. It would be better as a hiking bag or something where you don\\'t have to get things out very often in tight spaces like a lecture hall.', 330: \"I saw this in the Oakley store and bought it brand new on EBay and was disappointed with how uncomfortable it is. I work overseas so I would use it to travel. I went to the London Airport which is huge and it would be very uncomfortable around the shoulders. I could not adjust them so it would feel comfortable. I also would walk around with my 17 inch Laptop in the back and found the waist straps were cumbersome and useless. Its try difficult to adjust it when you have it on. Im 5'10 and it would sag down on my lower back causing discomfort on my back and on my shoulders. Also disappointing (not that I would buy it again) is that they only make one color. Black although they used to make a grey one but Oakley is very limited on their colors. The design is good for the bag but over long periods of wearing it then it becomes uncomfortable. A lot of pockets but Oakley needs to get better comfort and lighter colors. Its good if your going from your car to class but NOT for extended periods of use. Like over 30 minutes. AVOID AVOID AVOID! I would say again if you enjoy discomfort and pain around your shoulders and extra useless waist straps around your waist which get in the way when you walk than this bag is perfect for you. If not AVOID.\", 331: 'I carry an iPad w/keyboard, an unusually large amount of safety gear, my lunch and nearly all the liquids I plan to drink every day to my worksite, which is maybe 250 yards from my car. Then I must access the backpack repeatedly during the day. My old pack was a very large college-type model meant for a 17\" laptop and textbooks. I used it for almost eight years until, predictably, the main zipper was the first thing to wear out (from all the opening and closing). I bought this as a substitute a) because it claimed to be so large and b) for the special glasses compartment, which looked ideal for my safety glasses. I was willing to pay a premium price for very large capacity and durability.While the glasses compartment _is_ nice and the straps are padded well and comfortable, nearly everything else has been a disappointment. Not only is the thing actually not all that large, but it\\'s poorly laid-out to boot (at least for my needs). The secondary pouch, for example, is lined with hard-sided pockets that they not only don\\'t fit anything I own, they also take up so much space that I can\\'t put anything _else_ in there either. The main pouch is maybe 3/4 the size I\\'m used to, and can only accommodate my daily burden with careful arrangement. The waist-belt may be great for thin people, but this is America (the land of the obese) and it\\'s at _least_ a foot short of what I\\'d need in order to actually use the thing. The metal top handle is uncomfortable and awkward compared to a simple strap, especially when loads are heavy, and while the metal tie-downs on the back look well-anchored and capable of serious weight-bearing they\\'re not the sort of feature that an everyday user like me is liable to take advantage of. Worst of all, in order to open this pack one must undo two buckles in addition to unzipping a zipper. That gets very old the fifth or sixth time before lunch.I almost returned this-- the only reason I didn\\'t was because my old pack failed beyond further use on the day this arrived and I needed something _right now_ that was at least workable.

I already had the Oakley Men\\'s Radar Path Asian Fit Sunglasses but in another colour. When I tried the new ones on, the lenses touched my cheeks. Disappointed I compared them to my other Oakley Asian Fit Radars and there are subtle differences to indicate that I did not receive the correct Asian Fit version. The nose pads are not as big as my previous Asian Fit\\'s. They do not seem as wide in the nose. The shape is slightly different in that the previous Asian Fit sunglasses and they sit lower than they should for Asian Fit\\'s.That said, the packaging was for the Oakley Radar Polarized sunglasses. Like my previous pair of Asian Fit\\'s and from what the Oakley dealer said, there isn\\'t anything specific on the box to indicate they are \"Asian Fit\" versions. In the box, these sunglasses came with the same case, sleeve and extra nose pad/piece. The warranty information was included, but the Information for changing the lens was for the Radarlock not the Radar.I\\'m hoping to exchange if the seller can correctly send me the *true Asian Fit model* as advertised.  Otherwise, I am going to return them dissatisfied. I have not found if and where I can contact the seller with the issue of incorrect product being sent to ensure that this will be corrected if I send it back. I am wondering if other people have had this same issue also. I gave this one star rating not because the product is poor, but the purchase experience was that I did not receive what was advertised. Beyond the above issues, the frame was the colour I expected, but the lens (Polarized Black Iridium) was not as dark as I pictured from the picture shown. (Not a huge issue as I did reference Oakley\\'s website. Just a caution to others looking for a higher level on the protection index).', 339: \"I purchased the same sunglasses(radar path, iridium polarized) in a regular version, non-asian fit, a few months ago and the fit was awkward: it was touching my cheeks and the top part of the sunglasses was too far from my forehead. The worst part was a reflection of my forehead that could be seen on the internal part of the lenses. I gave these sunglasses to a caucasian friend and he did not have any issues with the fit or reflection/glare.Since you cannot try the asian version in the Oakley's stores, I decided to bite the bullet and order the asian version through Amazon. The asian version is slightly large as I am not feeling my temples being squeezed so hard, but I still have the same glare issue (forehead reflection) and the curvature of the lenses is too much for my face -  my cheeks are still touching the lenses. This model comes with an additional nose piece so that you can find a better fit. In my case, it did not help at all.Conclusion:Great sunglasses with amazing polarized lenses if you have a non-asian face. If you have problems with sunglasses in general, it is better to look elsewhere or try the non-asian version at the Oakley store so that you can make an informed decision. Watch out for reflections! I would recommend this product only for people that don't have major issues with fit. This version might help some asian faces, but not all of them.\", 340: 'i received and not original glasses i was fake. no warranty included, no bag. and not polarized lenses. i am very sad with  this product. i will return it.', 341: 'Too small for many sunglasses.

I did that on a guess and it worked out for the most part in the length and the width. The boot was not as narrow as say a Belleville. The fit was a little odd in the heel. It doesn't feel as supportive to the heel, but the instep is okay. The fit at the ankle doesn't seem to fit in the right places. It seems loose in the ankle and when you tighten it up circulation is affected more than gaining fit and stability. The lining is a little thicker than needs to be in a desert boot which makes it noticeably warmer inside than other desert boots. Haven't used into to the winter yet. The price I got it for makes it a buy that I don't regret necessarily, but I don't think I got the exact boot that I needed. I had also bought the black ones at the same time due to the price . The black pair do not seem to hold shape and they look way more worn compared to the desert ones. They do still seem to fit and perform the same. Oakley boots typically look like they wear faster than they actually do. If you have to be very active like climbing or you have to stand on your feet (heels) for very long time stay with another model Oakley or different brand that you may already like.

For guys, I guess they look decent, but I really thought they looked like those huge obnoxious glasses that women wear. I got them thinking they'd be a bit smaller and that I could wear them while playing sports in the sun, but boy was I wrong. However, they are great if you want to go around looking like a tool.

After only a year of using my Radars (and on weekends only), one of the stem sleeves came off unnoticed when I was adjusting the position of my Radars (this was done under a full-frame helmet, which is why it went unnoticed until I got back to my car).I was surprised by how easily the sleeve came off.  I figured, if it came off so easily, it must be pretty easy to install a new one.Wrong!  The new ones are installed just by slowly wiggling the sleeve onto the stem.  But it is so tight that I had to apply a lot of force, several times causing the stem to bend and making me fear that the glasses may break.  Overall, it took me about 30 minutes to install the one sleeve I needed, but many times along the way it felt like my $200 investment was about to break and go to the trash.

I might buy these again, though I would look for a model that was a bit more comfortable.', 379: 'i ordered these sunglasses about the 10th oct 2010 and i have still not recieved them. i have sent several emails but had no reply. i am very un happy about this matter and would like a reply at least and the sunglasses sending again.mar bromilow', 380: \"This is at least my 10th pair of Oakleys, 3rd or 4th pair of the Flak's, 2nd of the Red Sox Flaks. Needless to say, I am a fan.  It is also the first time I have received &#34;Oakleys&#34; further to referred to here as &#34;Foakleys&#34; (Fake-Oakleys). I will start by saying that there is a chance, small but there as I am no subject matter expert.... that I did not get ripped off.  I got the sunglasses awhile ago, 3-4 months ago, opened the box, normal Oakley case, cloth bag, certificate, etc. Glasses fit normally and seemed good. Quite honestly, I did not inspect them as I should of and I had no reason to. Life was good. 2 weeks ago, I was going through the airport and I noticed one of the lenses was loose and not right. Life was still good. Yesterday, I happened to be wearing them in an outlet mall, and walked by an Oakley shop. I went in and asked them to take a look at my glasses. All three staff members came to the conclusion that they were convinced that they were not real. As the store associates showed me specific things on the sunglasses I never noticed, I would say that I agree. The findings: red coating not evenly distributed over the plastic frame (spots of light paint/pink around the ear grips), spots not coated/painted at all where the hinges are on the sides (blatantly noticeable when they are closed), blurred stamped Oakley logo (the O on the left ear piece is not well defined and off center by a little), and non-standard dimensions (barely, but noticeable) from a pair of the same exact MLB Flak Jacket XLJ except from the Yankees (figures they were an NY fan, just kidding). I would of thought that the Oakley staff just wasn't capable or motivated to help me and was feeding me a line, however they actually fixed the &#34;Foakleys&#34; and apologized for me having bad luck by giving me a $25 coupon/discount in their store.\", 381: \"I'm a bit disappointed because there was no storage/cleaning bag included with OAKLEY Flak Jacket Sunglasses, only the soft vault case.\", 382: 'I would really like to get my money back or a replacement. I ordered these as a gift for my fianc&eacute;. As soon as he opened them on Christmas morning, the right lense fell off. After several attempts to get it on, it is now crooked and does not fit right. For the amount of money I paid, you would think I would get the quality that I paid for. I am very disappointed!!!', 383: \"I have worn Oakley Flak Jacket's for years. I recently ordered a set to replace my prior glasses that I have been wearing and when I put  on the new Flak Jackets, the frame of the glasses flexed a small amount and one of the lenses popped out. This happened over and over. I showed them to a Sunglass Hut person while walking through an airport, and they believed they were defective. So I ordered a second pair and - low and behold - within a week the same thing happened. Getting on an escalator to head outside a store, slid my glasses down from my forehead to put them on - and the lens popped out. Apparently Oakley has changed the design to allow lenses to be more easily interchanged, but this design is not acceptable. The lenses are simply not secure. Needless to say i returned second pair as well. I spoke with Oakley representative and they were very kind - but said they were not aware of this being a common issue. I ended up buying Oakley Fast Jacket XL. Not quite as stylish as the Flak Jacket - but a very, very nice sunglass. And Fast Jacket has a lever that secured the lense so it will definitely not be popping out.\", 384: \"They shouldn't advertise these as men's sunglasses they are way too small. I had my daughter try them on and they were way too small for her as well. I would return them but the box was inadvertantly thrown away.\", 385: \"These are ok.  I've had these a couple of times.  The only issue I have with them is that they stretch and become too big and want to fall off my face.\", 386: \"These glasses are short in that they leave uncovered a lot of field of vision at the bottom.  Perhaps the XLJ lenses would be better but I don't know - I bought and tried on only these based on the high reviews online but just trying them on my apartment shows that these are inappropriate for bright conditions because of the limited coverage: a lot of light will come in through the bottom.  The glasses are attractive and appear durable, so it's a shame. I am going to try the Oakley Racing Jackets instead.\", 387: 'it looks horrible in your face. My friend asked me to get this for her, and when I received I was so embarassed, did not know what to do with it. It is just to ugly', 388: \"I've had Oakley Flak Jacket Polarized glasses for 11 months (bought for about $200 in Orlando - downtown Disney Sunglass Hut in December of 2012) when I finally sent them for warranty replacement as the lenses were scratched beyond anything I've ever seen, basically rendering them useless. Now why would I complain if I abused them? What kind of not-very-smart-person sand blasts their glasses and then complains? However I did not. The glasses spent all of 11 months in that microfiber pouch Oakley gave me, mostly in the car. I never done any sports in them as I have no outdoor hobbies. Not playing any ball games, not hiking, not even running outside. Yet the surface of both lenses was absolutely destroyed. I brought them first to the store where I bought them and the manager immediately agreed that the lens wear was abnormal, especially given the fact that the frame had no detectable wear, but couldn't help me as it was not Oakley store. So I went to Oakley store in Orlando and a manager that also immediately agreed it was a defective pair and offered me 10% off another pair of lenses immediately. However I decided to send the glasses to the Oakley for the lens replacement. And I got to say that conversation with the warranty department was an eye opener. You can tell right away that Oakley gets tons of those complains simply by the way they talked to me. Their phrases, their entire attitude was trained, polished and refined in order to fend me off without as much as 1% discount of the new pair of lenses. They actually started conversation by requesting my credit card in order to sell me another pair of lenses  - that's before they even told me that the pair they received was reviewed. I talked to a rep, and then to a manager, and the result is the same: &#34;You scratched it, we are not going to discuss the lens quality, it is not covered by warranty, give us your credit card, the new pair of lenses is $100&#34;. That's all I got. Don't know about you folks, we all have our different scales when it comes to many things including money, but I felt paying $200 or a pair of glasses that can't last even a year of very gentle use is a rip off, which I told them on a phone. To which they replied &#34;it is not so, please give us your credit card, will send you a new pair of lenses&#34;. I feel like it was a rip off. I think the Oakley lens quality is junk, but their customer service is very proficient. At least in not giving up to demands of unhappy customers. I'm going to copy this review and post it in as many places as I can find as I'm quite upset with the whole ordeal.\", 389: \"Product wasn't cut properly. Decided to try to fix and ruined them, wouldn't have sent them back because of the low cost to begin with.\", 390: 'They are very tight and I had difficulty pulling them on the frame of the glasses.  I might try to heat them up a little to see if that helps, but the originals are a better fit.', 391: \"After having multiple paris of Flak Jackets and Half Jackets, I'm done with Oakley. These styles continually lose the nose pieces and I have had to re-purchased multiple times. The replacement nose pieces have never seemed to fit as well as the originals and are just a way for Oakley to further rape its customers for more money. I like the style of sunglasses and they have served me well in my outdoor activities, but nose pieces should be falling off at the rate these do. Also, before anyone adds their rebuttal, I take care of all my Oakleys and keep them in a hard case when not wearing, so I doubt that this would be attributed to &#34;normal&#34; wear-and-tear.\", 392: 'Really nice replacement parts for Oakley Flak Jacket sunglasses.  I just had a hard time fitting them in for my shades.', 393: 'Very difficult to actually slip on to the eye piece frames. I tried using a hair dryer to heat up the rubber thinking that would make it easier.', 394: 'I bought my boyfriend a pair of oakleys for his birthday, and bought him this case as well. He is an engineer and a car guy and has a thing for carbon fiber so I thought these would be perfect. They are too small to fit his glasses that I got him, even though they are just the normal \"whisker\" oakleys, not aviators or any other \"bigger\" sunglasses. I don\\'t even think the case is made of carbon fiber, it is just some sort of plastic with a carbon fiber pattern. My boyfriend says he doesn\\'t know if it is carbon fiber or not, but i\\'m pretty convinced that it isn\\'t. He still uses the case (he crams the glasses in there and it doesn\\'t close all the way) but I wish I had gotten him a different one.', 395: 'Definitely I was looking for something that offers more resistance and provides more safety. The case seems to be &#34;fashion&#34; but not really safe.', 396: 'It is perfectly round. Not a flat surface on it. Rolls off desks, tables and counters very well. But it has not broken yet (it goes in my back pocket and I sit on it regularly).', 397: \"I was sold on this product because it's appears to be carbon fiber, but it's not. It has some crappy plastic film that peels off that has a carbon fiber print surrounding a metal canister. It is sturdy but not carbon fiber!\", 398: \"I purchased this case due to provious comments mentioning how large this case was, however it's only large, not big volume, my Oakley Switch Style dos not fit into this case at all.\", 399: 'Sent it back. Too large to carry around. Because of its shape, it rolls off of surfaces. Not for me.', 400: \"Why would you make a case that is cylinder?When you put it down on a flat surface it rolls away. I don't need a case that helps me lose my sunglasses.I thought it would at least have some flat part on the bottom.\", 401: \"The case is actually plastic with a carbon like cover. It's really well made and you wouldn't notice until you scratch it or try to rub a stain off it.  The biggest problem is that it is really big. the smaller version I was told wouldn't fit my Oakley FIVE. I wish Oakley would provide a case with their expensive sunglasses or at least offer the option of a smaller case.\", 402: \"I've now gone through two of these cases and I give up. The first one I had broke within a year so I emailed Oakley to complain. To my surprise they offered to send me a new one at no charge. Less than a year after receive the new one, it broke this weekend when I opened it get my glasses out.When I mean it broke I mean that the spring inside the hinge pops and the lid no longer stays closed. Instead, it flops open and shut making the case useless for the most part.\", 403: 'It is a good case. It holds up to some abuse but forget it if you put this thing on a flat surface. It rolls right off! The styling is sleek.', 404: \"The pictures looked really cool. I love reading about what things are made of and the Iridian lenses sounded pretty amazing.When I first opened the package I was a bit ... neutral. The plastic frames feel like one of those generic sunglasses you'd run into growing up. The suspension feels nice and sturdy so it's got endurance. The real value is the lenses. Just looking at the reflection off of them looks damn sharp.I'm not an expert on sunglasses, but the frames just feel too toylike. For $107 these seem pretty decent.I was thinking of making these my regular glasses by popping out the lenses and replacing them with prescription ... we'll see. I'm use to titanium frames but my sweat makes green residue on them so that's why I thought about switching to plastic.Going to try and update this review when I give the shades more time.\", 405: \"Shipment was really quick, however photo did not match the description of the item when I received it. So disappointing because this was suppose to be a gift for my husband's birthday.\", 406: \"I've always worn the older version of these that were identical but didn't have the rubber tips on the arms and loved them. I recently needed a new pair and these were available instead of my old favorites and assumed they'd be just fine.  They're not!! Being a female with hair, my hair gets caught in the rubber covering on the arms, EVERYTIME I wear them. And I mean STUCK. There's a slit in the rubber that is at just the right angle to catch and the rubber ensures that it will not let go.  The only way out is to rip my hair! I've contacted Oakley and never received a response. Unless you have a buzz cut take your money elsewhere (or you may end up needing a buzz cut!)\", 407: 'my husbands wireframe oakleys broke so was looking to update them.  these were very nice but sorta made him look like he should be bass fishing.  sent them back', 408: 'I ordered the Multi Frame/Tungsten and they are a perfect match for the lenses they were replacing.The lenses I received were not polarized, however. They were listed at a lower price than the other color options, but it is still disappointing.Also, the product description seems to be giving the dimensions of the Gascan S frames, not the lenses. It also indicates that a case is included but this is not true.', 409: \"I received my new lenses in a huge box that had no cushioning for the smaller Oakley box containing the lenses. The OEM Oakley box was crushed and appeared to be worn as if it had been opened a few times before but I proceeded to open the box containing the Oakley lenses. Inside the worn box were the OEM Radar Range Polarized Black Iridium Sunglasses that I ordered, however, they had a massive amount of fingerprints and dirt on them as if someone with olive oil on their hands had handled them. If that wasn't bad enough there was a small square part that looked like it had been rubbed against something abrasive. It wasn't a single line scratch or a impact mark but rather it looked like something rubbed against it. I did attempt to clean the lenses with OEM Oakley cleaner that I own for my Batwolfs but the scratch is pretty deep. I probably would have kept them if there wasn't permanent  damage to them. At $165 these should be in pristine condition and perfectly clean. I ordered through amazon since  the Oakley store is a bit of a hassle to go to. Wish this would have been an easy purchase. I hope that mine was just a bad lemon and they aren't using used or opened lenses. I still can't comprehend how they got so dirty let alone damaged. For anyone who may still order, these are real OEM Oakley lenses so I hope you have a better experience than I did. As for me, I'll just take a ride down to my Oakley store this weekend. Edit: These don't include the microfiber bag/cloth shown in the picture! I should have realized it isn't under the product specs but just a heads up!\", 410: 'Extremely thin. Incredibly flimsy. Going to get another one. The Gascan is FAR better than this junk. I think it might be fake.', 411: 'Very nice shades but I just didint get a proper fit on my face from them.

Not a wise purchase at all.', 416: \"These sunglasses are beautiful. The shipping was very quick and on time. However...When I opened the case, I noticed instantly that the frame was bent and the nose cushion was pushed in to the frame. They look ridiculous. I'm insulted that these were sent to me. Either someone thought this seller wouldn't notice, they don't take care of their inventory, they don't check the merchandise before sending, OR the packager wasn't bright enough to notice these defect. Either way I'm very disappointed. $170 is a stretch for sunglasses so I will be returning these and will just take the drive to the Oakley store.\", 417: \"Oakley does not have a lifetime warranty on their eyewear. It is a 1-year warranty against manufacturer's defects from the date of original purchase, and it only covers the frames, not the lenses.These sunglasses do not come with an iridium-coated lens. The iridium coating is the mirror finish on the lenses and almost all women's eyewear by Oakley does not come with iridium lenses as an option. The lenses in the Restless are a gradient lens, which means the color goes from darker at the top, to lighter at the bottom.Just thought I should clear some things up so that customers aren't confused...\", 418: \"They have some cheap white plastic looking stuff on the bows and they don't fit well.  When they are in the proper position on my nose, my eyelashes hit the inside of the lenses. Returned them!\", 419: 'I saw this on amazon and didnt try it at the store. I like the design and it looks like a modern avator style. When it arrived after they ship it, I was so dissappointed. It doesnt fit on my face. It keeps sliding on my nose, and the temple hugs on the side of my face. I guess this is not for Big faces and small nose.

They are great when your going straight but when you turn your head to look behind you the bottom half of the frame ( the jawbone ) blocks your field of vision by 30%. As far as the vented lenses go, they are good at night but when the sun is beaming at you the vents let the sunlight in and you can see five seperate beams of light coming through. It is very distracting. Also the lenses do not change as easy as you think you better have a wipe ready because you will get them full of fingerprints.', 422: 'The optics on the sunglasses are great and it is really easy to change lenses.  But I have a wide face and a wide nose, and these do not fit my face as well as other glasses.', 423: 'Returned product - They were too big for my face. I have a very small face and the lenses on these glasses were too big they covered my cheeks.  Otherwise they were of high quality with the nice zipper case.', 424: \"Just received these Pit Bosses, today. The Packaging is very impressive. Too impressive, in fact. One might suspect that the elaborate packaging makes up a good portion of the ~$600.00 price tag. Glasses seem to be of fairly good quality but nothing spectacular. I expected a lot more, for the money. I'm a little bit disappointed that Oakley would market something like this.The fit is very snug and could be uncomfortable, for long use. XX Metal (24K Gold Iridium) and Romeo (Polished, Black Iridium) are better quality, more comfortable and less expensive.I'll add to this review, after extended wearing. For now, I'd recommend saving the $$$ and directing it to other Oakley products.UPDATE; These Oakleys are very good functionally. Polarized lens does an excellent job of screening UV rays. The fit is actually OK for extended use. But, $600.00 worth of technology? Still a 'NO'.\", 425: 'These sunglasses are very light weight which some people like but to me they felt flimsy and cheap - not what I expected for the price.', 426: 'I purchased these sunglasses in Feb and it is now only April and one of the arms has fallen off.  It is past my return day so I guess I am out of luck!', 427: 'I love the design and feel of this style shades by Oakley.  I have owned 3 pair.  The major flaw with the Compulsives is that the screw works itself out and one of the arms falls off of the glasses.  The screw is not the average sunglass size screw, so typical sunglass screws will not fit.  So, you end up only being able to wear the sunglasses for a brief amount of time, approximately 3-5 months in my case.  When I pay $140 for Oakleys, I want them to hold up for at least a year. Oakley should have named this style \"Self Distruct\".', 428: \"They did not fit my wife even though she's Asian.  I'm deducting both stars for that, otherwise they seemed to be very nice sunglasses.  I know it's a generic branding but she's Korean and does not have abnormal features for her race.It's one of those items that you may need to test before you buy.  I can't say that's easy because we had trouble finding anyone carrying the Asian Fit Oakley sunglasses around us and none in this style.  We returned them easily with Amazon and bit the bullet in a retail outlet we found carrying a different brand that fit her features well.\", 429: \"the design of the 'dangerous' is really cool, but unfortunately the asian fit style is still too narrow on the frames for comfort. they'd be pretty amazing if you're looking for a narrower 'asian fit' style, as the sunglasses have more of a 'wraparound' fit and the curve of the lenses is much more pronounced than some of oakely's other styles.the thing i really like about oakleys is that theres very little in the way of obnoxious logos or branding - just a small detail on the hinges. the frames are also really well made - the 'dangerous' is a bit heavier than some of the other thinner-framed styles. try these if you have a smaller face but still want all the fit benefits of oakley's asian fit line!\", 430: \"I should have provably known that before hand, but I didn't.  I though I was buying from Amazon with their easy no hassle returns, I will never buy anything from this site...thanks!The shades are ok but are to small.  When folded the arms will hit the lens.\", 431: 'The shape and interior desing of this sunglasses is great but you need to be aware that when you fold the temples hit the lenses inside and scratch them (there is no to ther way store them). Also the lenses are really clear I expected them to be more dark.', 432: 'The glasses are nice and really nice quality. They do touch the top of your cheeks so every time I smiled they moved. Passed them on to a friend with lower cheek bones!  Still great quality. Second Oakley pair I have had this issue with!', 433: \"I have a tiny face in the first place so it is hard to find a pair that actually fit. These were too big. But I really like the style of them, so I guess I'll keep them. Very light and comfortable.\", 434: \"Love the style of the Womens Compulsive squared sunglasses.  They look sharp and I got several compliments on the style.  The sad thing is that Oakley fell short on quality with the Compulsives.  I went through 3 pair of Compulsives in a short amount of time.  When I pay the extra cash for Oakleys, I have an expectation that I am purchasing a well-made product that will last if I take great care of the item.  I took very good care of the shades, and each time the arms of the glasses detached from the lenses.  The screws fall out and are lost due the small size. Regular sized sunglass repair screws don't fit the Compulsives.  So, the Compulsives can't be repaired.  In my opinion, Oakley needs to step-up quality on the Compulsives so the consumer can get what they pay for.\", 435: \"Over the years I've purchased about 6 pair of Oakley's but most recently I bought these Polarized Oakley Half Jackets back in March 2008.Pros:I like the way they fit by clinging to to your head. They are lightweight and comfortable as well. They are stylish and perform well at blocking the sun from your eyes. The frames are durable.Cons:The lenses are NOT scratch resistant at all. After owning several pair of Oakleys, I know very well how to care for them by only using the cloth that comes with them and I take very good care of my subglasses. Nevertheless about 3 weeks after I bought them I found a small scratch on the right lens. A few weeks later I was at the beach and somehow one of the plastic nose guards fell off by itself, never to be found again. Another few months went by and I noticed that the coating started flaking off the lenses. Now the sunglasses are about a year and a half old and the flaking has gotten so bad that I can't wear them anymore. I'm pretty upset about this seeing as how I dished out $200 for sunglasses that only last a little over a year. My other pairs of Oakleys have held up better in the past but a few were lost or stolen so I only had maybe 3 pair long enough to stop wearing them. But inevitably it always ends the same way.. with scratches all over the lenses after only a few months. It seems that they have been getting more and more cheaply made over the years while their prices have stayed the same or increased.So I'm done with Oakley and their cheap lenses. No more. Purchase at your own risk!\", 436: \"These sunglasses were nice looking, so I bought them as a gift for my husband. They were shipped very fast, but the sunglasses were way too small.

I never had that problem with any other pair of sunglasses , whether they were a pair of Ray Bans , Revo's or just a cheap pair bought at a gas station in an emergency . I have worn other people's Oakley sunglasses and they felt great . So if you don't have a kid sized head , don't buy these . Although they would be perfect for mabey an early teenage boy .\", 439: \"I have owned three pairs of these in the Asian Fit model.  I have a wider head and it has always been tough to find good-fitting sunglasses and I love the fit of these so much I keep buying them despite the fact that the lenses on the Half-Jacket Iridium (both polarized and non) are not very durable at all.  I wish that Oakley would upgrade their lens manufacturing process so that the lenses are more durable and more scratch resistant.Pros:Lightweight, durable frames with no metal parts that can be bent or screws that can fall out.  The frames' temples (parts that hold the lenses and front frame to the head) attach to the front frames via a squeeze/clip hinge that allows the whole thing to just fall apart if sat on, crushed or otherwise contorted.  I rock climb, bike, surf, ski and much more with these glasses and other than the really poor scratch resistance of the lenses these things are virtually indestructible.Cons:Lenses scratch VERY easily and are VERY expensive to replace.\", 440: 'I am so upset that it came without a hard case.

If your smart and like this style of Oakley glasses, buy the Oakley Holbrooks, there the same style, just made in the U.S.A and there actual designer glasses quality. My father had these sunglasses as a child and he says they haven't changed much in quality as they have always been cheaply made\", 449: \"Very Flimsy and hinges are made of plastic, and in my experience glasses with plastic hinges tend to break easily. Also the Iridium tint isn't that good very easy to see through from the outer point of view.  On the good side they are light.  I got the white version and returned them.  If you want something similar like these but doesn't have that flimsy feel and a better reflecting tint, and cheaper,  I'd suggest getting the dicks cotton cape cod Wayfarer sunglasses which you can buy here or on their website.\", 450: \"Face it these are not your original Frogskins.

Amazon's packaging is always good so i have no probs with that!however, the lens did come darker than the pic shows. i was looking for something loud (red seemed like a loud colour yes?) so i bought this but the lens werent as reflective as they looked. if you are gg for something loud, i'll think the white frame frogskin will be better\", 452: \"I had a pair of Frogskins back in Jr. High (circa 1992 or so) that were straight up awesome.

Things wrong with them:1) The lens are straight up purple.  Not reddish purple, but purple.  Not for me.2) Glasses feel shockingly cheap.  My original Frogskins held up to a bunch of abuse and had a bit of beefiness to them.  A previous review here on Amazon pretty much summed it up that these feel even worse that gas station quality.  It really is amazing how cheap these feel.3) I got a lot light reflection from the lens when the sun was behind me, so much so that wearing the glasses was an annoyance.I have plenty of pairs of Oakleys and other brand sunglasses, but I'd say these are the most disappointing sunglasses that I've ever bought.Maybe for kids these days that don't remember the late 80's/early 90's like I do, these might be fine.  But if you're a little older like me (mid-30's) and are wanting to relive those days, it's not happening with these newest Frogskins.\", 453: 'I can not keep these on my normal sized head.

The iridium lenses are unlike any other Oakley iridium lense I have ever seen, they are completely see through, not at all like the normal mirroring of iridium lenses. These will definately be getting returned, if they drop a 0 from the price I would consider them again, as a throw-away pair.', 462: 'The right leg keeps popping off.

Mine failed after about 8 months of use...it took 4 months to get Oakley to honor the warranty and fix them.  When I got them back they worked for 6 more months then died.So, I'm going to purchase a new pair...I'm looking for an extended warranty though.Update on 4/6/10:I purchased the new pair from Amazon in 12/09.The Up Volume switch is failing after 3 months so I called Oakley at 800-403-7449 4/6/10 at 12:47.  Was on hold for 12 mins, finally  spoke w/Jordan at 12:59 only to find he couldn't help me so he put me on hold again.  Finally spoke w/Tim at 1:03.  He says Amazon is a third party unlicensed retailer and so it voids the warranty.  OAKLY DOES NOT HONOR O ROKR WARRANTIES FROM AMAZON??  He tells me it's a non-authorized site.  If I wanted Oakley to fix the glasses it would b a $49 non-warranty.Luckily I bought the Square Trade warranty.  Went to file a claim on Square Trade.  Their automated system was easy to use.  It said that my claim should be handled by the manufacturer-(Oakley)-as the glasses were still w/in warranty.  Great.. Called Square Trade at 14:05 and was put on hold at 877-900-7283 spoke w/William at 2:08.  They'll send me UPS prepaid shipping label.  Then it'll go through audit process.  Once passed through Audit process they'll pay me what I paid for unit.  Can do Paypal but also would do check.  I opted for check.  Emailed me UPS label.

By that, I don't mean they don't fit well, because the fit is perfect. I mean the frame to face ratio for me is a little off for what I like in sunglasses.

They don't hurt the nose like many sporty sunglasses do, but they put a lot of pressure on above my ears.  After wearing these for about 30 minutes, I have to take them off for a while for a break.  I'm bummed because they look great and have awesome lenses, but they just hurt.  It's probably just that I have a big, sensitive head.

However, once these are on your face, they lose that translucent look and turn black. People seeing you wearing your new shades will have no idea what color they are. They don't really stand out.On the positive, they fit great and the style does look cool. Sometimes I do get a minor headache when wearing them. I heard this is an existing problem for some people with Oakleys. Your periferal vision can see the nose frame and under eye frame.

Evidently, those days are gone.So I called there customer service and they said the only fix they would offer me is a new pair of lenses for $80 with no guarantee the same thing wouldn\\'t happen again. Economically, it makes no sense, so now two and a half years in I have to buy a new pair of sunglasses. When I pressed their customer service guy further, asking if this was now a common problem, he replied, \"not with all of the glasses\" strongly implying by his tone that many of their glasses had this problem.For the record, He also told me that Oakleys had a one year warranty on the lenses.For the going price of $130 there area many better options out there from companies that will stand behind their product.', 533: 'They do not fit snug and always fall down when putting them up on my head while not wearing or going inside a building.

They fit my 10 year daughter perfectly but really didn\\'t do a very good job covering the bottom portion of my eyes. Hard to explain the fit but they should be classified as a juvenile or Asian fit.*I also wanted to mention that I find it very disturbing that anybody that gives their honest opinion about these sunglasses with a less than 5 star rating is instantly mobbed with \"unhelpful\" votes. You can look down the list of reviews and see it is true. I\\'m sure I will be the next victim but this is incredibly unfair.

The frame sits about 3/4 down range of my eyesight so that I cannot see my speedometer while driving unless I turn my head down, and away from the road. It blocks my peripheral vision as well. I have to turn my head over 90 degrees in order to see my blind spot.

They would be a good buy for $30-$40...As far as the seller goes, got the glasses in quick and the packaging was great. No complaints for them.

I recently purchased the Jawbone model and I like it very much.  Contruction quality is quite good, and I especially like the interchangable lenses.  Quality through and through.But be careful with the intended use of this model.  I think they are quite fine for cycling and other sports where vision takes place at a distance. But I would not recommend them for action/high-speed sports, such as baseball and softball.The issue is the frames - this style uses a very thick frame, especially below the eye.  While it does look cool and doesn't particularly detract from your vision when you are looking strait ahead, there are issues when you need to look down.  The extra thick frames will block a certain portion of your vision below you, and this could cause an injury.I was recently playing softball and a particuarly hard-hit grounder was hit to me.  In the fraction of a second the ball travelled the six or so feet in front of me into my glove, the ball is basicually blocked from your vision. For me, in that last six feet the ball took a bad hop, and was deflected slightly from the pocket of my glove and instead hit my right ring finger, causing it to be dislocated.  Upon reflection of the event, I feel a strong contributing factor was the thick frame blocking my lower vision making it harder for me the track a high speed ball, especially if it takes a bad hop.  I think for such sports, the M-Frame from Oakley or possibly the Flak Jacket would be better as there are no frames below the eye.\", 575: 'I wish I could give this 0 stars.

They were very expensive and they required buying left & right lenses, not just the one needed.  The fix did not remain very long and the right lens soon popped out again.  Liking the style and thinking it was an isolated problem, I like an idiot bought another pair.I hate arrogant & greedy companies that make money off their own design flaws without telling their customers that this is a chronic problem that they are well aware of.

They sent them back to me and guess what????  The other temple is now separated from the face in exactly the same way.  Must have just fallen apart on the way TO or FROM Oakley!!! Yeah, right!

I recently contacted Oakley about having them repaired, but I am seeing people mention the same problem on several websites.Edit: I contacted Oakley about repairing these glasses, and they wanted seventy dollars for the fix since I didn't have my receipt showing when/where I bought them. I could buy another nice pair of sunglasses for that. I won't buy anything Oakley brand again.\", 593: \"I liked my pair, up until it broke yesterday.  The left hinge broke on it.  And doing a little online searching, I'm finding that's a common issue with the Square Wire, with people reporting having to replace it multiple times.  Unfortunately mine just went out of warranty.  I've never had any pair of glasses break in my life, this was my first and last pair of Oakleys.\", 594: \"First, I love the shape, style, and color of these shades!  They look great, they feel comfortable, and they form-fit the head nicely!  A person could wear them all day without feeling a looming headache or anything.Secondly, the clarity of the lenses (when undamaged -- I'll get to that in a minute) is fantastic.  They do a supurb job of cutting light to a bearable level, and there is no sideways or reverse glare.  I've had some sunglasses you can't wear at certain times of day because all that happens is the light reflects back off of the inside of the lense.  These Oakleys don't have that at all.Now for part three -- damage resistance.  Here's where I'm quite dissatisfied!  I received these glasses as a birthday present and had them only about a month when they fell off of my head.  It seems the left side loosened up, and (I'm a runner) I could feel them begin to bounce on my face frequently as I was running.  Unfortunately, they fell off of me and hit the pavement one time -- no bounce, no scraping, just one single hit and stop motion.  That's it!  In that short time, the right lens picked up a major chip right where your eye looks through.  I'd certainly hate to have had a rock flying right at my eye or something!!!  Of course, Oakley won't warranty the lenses so I'll have to pay a substantial amount to get the replacement.The thing is, I've had $12.00 sunglasses that are more durable than these, and at $200+ per pair, I'd expect to be able to kick them around quite a bit without damage; yet, I didn't even do that!  It makes me question their value and their overall durability.The bottom line is, if you're *extremely* careful and tighten the sides frequently while wearing them gingerly (no heavy-duty contact stuff), you'll likely love these shades.  Otherwise, let's press Oakley to improve their durability standards substantially!\", 595: \"Seller Sunglasstop is NOT an authorized Oakley retailer.  Amazon has dropped the ball by not mentioning this anywhere on the page.  I received the sunglasses and after less than a day of usage, noticed that the right arm would swing freely and had no pressure to keep it folded or opened in the correct position.  I emailed the seller and asked what I needed to do to have a warranty repair done, they stated that I would most likely be charged by Oakley to have any repairs done.  When further pressed, they stated that they weren't an authorized retailer and therefore warranties did not apply.  It would have been very nice to have known this before.  I took it to a local optometrist's office to see if they could do a fix, and they stated that only Oakley would be able to fix it, that it was missing a screw and no repair shop would be able to do the repair.  Sunglasstop's representatives stated that these were 100% authentic Oakley sunglasses, and while that might be true, all it means is that they were produced in the Oakley factory.  These are most certainly quality control rejections that Sunglasstop has gotten a cut rate price on and foisted them off on Amazon.  Spend the extra $40 and get a new pair from an authorized retailer, don't waste your time here.  If you do decide to, caveat emptor...these will not be what you're expecting if you want a decent pair of sunglasses.\", 596: 'Square Wires look great and are comfortable, however they are the most fragile Oakley product I have ever used.

My single most irritating issues is that they don't offer DOD civilians working in war zones any significant discounted prices. Many fine companies do and many (including Starbucks) offer free product. Yes, Oakley offers a military line at a discount, but they are far inferior to the consumer brands, so they aren't offering the military and their support any value.

It was horrible! I have taken them to my eye doctor and had them adjust them and to no avail, still leaves marks and now has put so much pressure on my nose i get headaches. The frame is too heavy and not distributed evenly so it all ends up on your nose and since the nose pieces never fit right and honestly i don't think are designed correctly to support all that weight.

They tell you in the store it\\'s unisex even though on the Oakley website it says \"Exclusive design for women\". Honestly, the design fits a male more than a female. Unisex is more accurate for couple of reasons:1- Weight: the glasses are heavy and fit a male more than a female (The only color that will suite a male would be the black chrome frame with the warm gray lenses).2- The lens approximation to the eyes. males have shorter eye lashes in general and this might be a smaller problem to them. you can adjust the nose pieces and push them away from the frame to increase the space you have for your eye lashes.3- The design in general looks more masculine than feminine.If you are a woman and you really like the looks of those glasses try them for half an hour and walk around. if you can fix the nose pieces and you are ok with the weight go for it. you have a wide range of beautiful colors for the frame and lenses to mix and match.If you are a male go for the black chrome / warm gray combination.', 609: \"I had these sunglasses for less than a year when the film started pealing off the glass.

I like how these glasses look, but for what I paid for them, I think they should have had better QC done on them. I've told Oakley both times I've had to replace them that the hinges have a default. I think it has to do with the spring within the connection of the earpiece to the lens piece, as they can easily slip back on the unit, but they don't stay there. Basically I have found that all you are paying for is the name, but the actual units themselves are cheap. I've found that the $10 grocery store glasses actually put up with more abuse, not that I've ever abused these. They were always taken care of but apparently since my head is a little fatter that the spring eventually will fail because they are always being pushed out when they are put on. Not sure I would go and spend that much money again just to have the faulty spring fail and have to deal with trying to get another replacement.

My nine year old pair of Calvin Klein sunglasses had finally worn out, so I decided it was time to buy a \"real\" pair of sunglasses. The cost of the Half Wires was considerably higher than any pair of prescription sunglasses I\\'d previously owned (Porsche Design, Ray-Ban, Calvin Klein), but based on my experience with their watches, I was convinced that the quality would be far superior. I was wrong.When picking up the Oakleys from the local authorized dealer, I immediately noticed that one of the set screws had created a slight crack in the lens it was securing, and the lens itself was slightly loose. Already having been without a serviceable pair of sunglasses for several weeks, I was told that their warranty would handle any problem that might develop, so I left as a proud owner of a new pair of Oakleys. Over the next three or four months, the crack in the lens slowly grew, and the lens began to rock in the frames. I took the glasses back to the dealer, they contacted Oakley, and several weeks later, I was happily wearing a new pair with tight fitting lenses and no crack defects.Less than ten months later, I took out my Half Wires to put on, opened them up, and one of the temple pieces popped right out of the main frame, sending the glasses spinning to the pavement. They landed on the bottom edge of both pristine lenses, causing two small divots in the bottom edge of both lenses. Returning once again to the dealer, I subsequently found out that my Oakleys were no longer under warranty, even though they had been replaced with a brand new pair less than eight months earlier. Now on backorder for the past month, the replacement frames will be provided to me for a cost $30 less than retail when they come in. Better than full retail cost I suppose, but I will now have a new pair of frames that shouldn\\'t have broken in the first place with two damaged lenses. Oakley responded with a nondescript corporate line that disavowed any further responsibility.Being a detail oriented architect, I take immaculate care of my glasses, and I am very disappointed that the lifespan of their glasses is apparently so limited. I haven\\'t taken them rock climbing, jet skiing or base jumping - pity the fool that does. I even wore my old soldered together Calvin Kleins when I went white water canoeing earlier this summer because I didn\\'t want to risk losing the Oakleys. Companies live and die between the perception and reality of their product line, and while stylish design will get you accolades and customers, longevity is what keeps the customers coming back for more.', 614: \"I had the exact same problem as georgie. The ear stems are attached in a very fragile fashion that leads to them pulling out from the frame of the glasses. This can only be repaired by replacing the metal piece that attaches the ear piece to the glasses. The ease at which this piece fails is a design flaw of the glasses, and should be supported better by Oakley when it fails. After paying shipping and getting my glasses back 2 weeks later I was disappointed to find that while Oakley had repaired the glasses, they had left them with uneven tension on each side. The result was that one ear piece would flex outward more easily than the other, and thus the glasses sat unevenly on my face. A month later the ear piece disconnected again rendering the glasses useless. I haven't sent them back again since Oakley wanted $40 to repair the glasses after the 1 year warranty period. This experience has completely turned me off from Oakley glasses.Pros:Great optical qualityVery attractive lookCons:HeavyBreaks easilyPoor customer service\", 615: \"I purchased these glasses in August of 2009.Pros:* Great design (appearance-wise)* The picture quality the lenses produce is superbCons:* I wore them no more then 20-30 times before the earpiece simply detached. It appears the earpiece is not bolted but glued to the frame and the glue is simply not good quality. Oakley did agree to service them (after I paid for shipping to them), however I can't help to wonder how much longer they will last.* The lenses scratch very easily. I take care of these glasses a lot better then I do of my running and biking glasses. Yet, the lenses already have some quite visible scratches.* The frame is quite heavy.Overall:Knowing what I know now I would not have bought these glasses.\", 616: \"I recieved these as a birthday gift from my wife. I personally would never have spent so much for sunglasses, but the more i wore them the more I loved them. I also recieved a hard case to protect my precious glasses. I took care of these more than I had ever taken care of any sunglasses. I was previously using a pair of Panama Jack 15$ ish glasses from WalMart, and never took care of them. I threw them on the dash, they slid on the floorboard. Threw them in bags with other stuff, never in a protective case. After not even a year I noticed Specks on the Oakley's Lenses.. I though damn, I must have dropped them. Then time passed and then were more and more specked up. I actually lost them for a couple of months and then found them in my car protected in a glove. The lenses looked worse then they did before. I still use them almost Three years later but the Lenses are Horrible. I stopped in a Oakley store twice and they just say It must have been the chemicals in my hair, sorry. Basically youre on your own. Finally one day I Searched and found all kinds of issues with Oakley's Polarized film peeling away after warranty period and that they didn't stand behind their product. The Frames are excellent and sturdy, but the lenses suck. The lenses on the Panama Jack $15 pair are 90% better then the Oakley's, sure since I abused them they are a little scratched, but nowhere near how bad the Oakley's are. I would still be using the Cheap ones if my daughter didnt grab a hold of them and break off the arms. Today I noced a Company selling replacements for half the cost of Oakley's, EyeCandy Lenses, So I will try their replacements and see if they are any better. I will never go with oakley again at least out of my pocket, Ray Ban's seem to be a good Alternative.\", 617: \"I am a DIE HARD Oakley fan.  I own 18 pairs of Oakleys, countless clothing items and 2 watches.  When I got these shoes home, they didn't look right.  I wear an 11.5, and ordered a 12.  The 12 wouldn't even fit on my foot.

The watch is very cheap looking due to its thin metal case.  The band is a very cheap grade of rubber and the buttons to control the movement are clunky in the way they reset the watch dials.  For a $600 dollar watch its very cheap. I think Oakley should price them at $50.00 tops.  My $300 Swiss Army is by far a superior build quality.

The product was shipped promptly by Amazon as usual and arrived in good shape.  My husband liked the way they looked and tried them on and realized that even though it says size 9 on them, they are cut much smaller than usual - he says they are at most a size 8.  So I decided to return the product and re-order a size larger that will probably fit.  While returning the product on line I had to pick the return category, and of course at the end of everything I input, the \"system\" conclusion was that this is not Amazon\\'s fault but my husband\\'s that they are cut too short and his regular size took a cut! So I am told that I have to pay for shipping almost $6 (while when shipped to me was estimated at $2.85 or so...).  So not only it is not your fault they are defective in size, but I have to pay DOUBLE to return them, when it should be free.  And he wants me to replace them, but I think I can find them somewhere else...  I think that you should revise this policy and do the right thing, and not deduct useless shipping from my credit.

My other issue with this product is that the inside beige heel part on which a persons' foot lays started to wrinkle up on one of the sandals (a couple of air bubbles appeared underneath it) and it's not the same comfortable feel after that.

The inner pouch and glasses appeared intact though, and I'm no Oakley aficionado, so I figured maybe they all are boxed like that. Besides, my husband really needs a new pair of high quality sunglasses, so I wrapped them up.Well, they were pretty obvious losers once my husband opened them and wore them for a bit. They are ugly. Like those massive wrap around things many elderly people wore in the 1980's ugly. It's not obvious from the photo, but the sides are massive. Just really unattractive. The other problem is that they seem to be designed to look cool while sitting with arms open on a table, but not actually fit the human head. The arms curve, and come around into a sort of pincer grasp just behind the ears. Rather than hugging your skull, the clamp it. My husband wore them maybe an hour (while driving) before he gave up and said they were just too uncomfortable to keep, and got a couple of irritated dents in his skin for his trouble.They might be fine performance wise, but I don't recommend buying them unless you can try them on first.

Amazon had no problem issuing a refund including the shipping cost.Next time I will get the genuine lenses direct & not screw around with sellers who advertise fake products as genuine.', 696: 'I got these glasses because they look really cool and should be high quality due to the Oakley brand.  I had some initial concern regarding these glasses due to some reviews of these glasses where people reported them literally falling apart while they were wearing them.  I had written off these bad reviews to people who were overly rough on their glasses or had broken them on accident, however, it turns out there is a fundamental design flaw with these glasses.Here is my experience with these glasses:When I first got my glasses with the prescription lenses mounted, I found that the place that did the lenses forgot the transitions coating.  No problem, send them back to add the coating.  When I got them back the second time, the glasses appeared mangled and bent out of shape.  When the optician tried to re-adjust them, all but one screw came out with the relatively light pressure she applied.  When she put them back together, they fell apart again.  The problem is that the screws that hold the frame to the lens only go a thread or two into the frame, so that after the stress of a re-assembly, or wearing them for a short period of time, they will fall apart and are very difficult to repair.  In my case, the optician used  some slightly different screws she had to put them back together.  However, on one of the sides the screw did not go into the frame all the way, so one of the sides is now wobbly and gets a strange build up on the lens as a result.  Now I am just waiting for them to fall apart again...If the mechanical integrity of these glasses is not bad enough, I also found these glasses to be extremely poorly designed from an optical standpoint.  The fundamental problem is that the lenses need to be thicker for the \"frame-less\" design.  However, the lenses are angled such that the bottom of the lens reflects ambient light directly into your eyes.  I have found that in normal lighting conditions, the glare is significant enough to actually make my vision worse than with my old glasses (which have an old prescription and inferior quality lenses).  The lenses I got for the Evades also have the anti-glare-coating, but it does nothing for the glare reflected off the bottom of the lenses (I even needed to get the optician to prove the anti-glare coating was actually applied).  And if you find yourself in a lighting situation where the surrounding area is dark but there is still overhead light (like in the forest around sunset), you will either need to block the overhead light, or be very good on not tripping on things.In Summary:-These glasses are extremely fragile due to insufficient screw mounts.-Glare from the bottom of the lens significantly degrades optical clarity.On a positive note for me, prior to getting the Oakley Evades I wore my cheaper glasses 90% of the time and my contacts about 10% of the time.  But since these glasses are so epically terrible, I now wear contacts 90% of the time, which my wife actually prefers.', 697: 'I have worn glasses my entire life and can say without reservation, these are the worst glasses I have ever owned in over 50 years of wearing glasses. The screws are ridiculously poor quality and they will, without fail, fall apart apart after wearing for a short time...You can try to put them back together, but just like Humpty Dumpty, they will never be in the orginal configuration.  Oakley needs to fix these terrible engiering flaws and replace those frames that have fallen apart on owners.  Oakley has definitely lost a customer here and I will ensure my co-workers and friends know of these poorly designed glasses.', 698: 'Description is incorrect replacement lense is not polarised. The shade is not made in a polarised option unless custom made. Check manufacturer site for correct discription.', 699: \"I've bought 2 of these before. One because I had the glasses for so long and 2 because my friend decided to ziptie the earsocks and I had to cut the earsocks off. But I hate these with a passion because the nosepiece always falls off (it May just be me) and they are impossible to get on and when I take them off they stretch out and are unusible. Someone said to put some loon onand that might help so I'm gonna try it when my new ones come in. And it's 8 pieces of rubber why am I spending $18\", 700: \"Not sure why, but they did not fit my half jackets. I have had these sunglasses for over ten years and this is the second set of earsocks that I have purchased (the first set I purchased directly from Oakley). I still have the box from the first set, and they have the same model number (06-200), but I could not even get the earsock over the tip of the earpiece. I don't know whether the wrong kit was put into the box, but I have returned them, and ordered a new set directly from Oakley.\", 701: \"I was hoping that these would look just like they do in the pic on the glasses...they don't...they are almost a clear color with brownish tint...actually look black on the glasses...but hey, the other ones were shot and these work/fit great\", 702: \"Basically Oakley is charging you 13 bucks for what amounts to be a couple of very cheap pieces of rubber.

I should have looked into the product further, but with the pictures of polarized lenses and the description explaining the lenses I expected it to be polarized.Aside from them not being polarized and me paying for the polarized, they are a great product. They fit the frames I have and they look clear with no scratches.', 706: 'The picture clearly shows a set of polarized lenses. These are not the polarized lenses in the picture. Pretty disappointed.', 707: 'These are very comfortable and the lenses are the best I have ever used (Black Iridium Polarized).  I have had them a few months and have taken very good care of them, only cleaning them with the included oakley case, and have stored them in a hard case as well.  Unfortunately now they have 1 scratch that seemingly came from nowhere, one minute they were fine and the next they had a big scratch right in my direct line of sight.  i dont remember hitting my head or anything in those couple of minutes so I have no idea where it came from.  Unfortunately now I have to buy a brand new set of lenses at $85 if I want to keep these, as the scratch is driving me crazy.', 708: 'Ordered these then ended having to buy a brand new pair of glasses they scratched very easy even when being careful with them.  Not worth the money at all', 709: 'These are of high quality, especially for plastic frames. The lenses are also very good, very reflective and cuts the glare down to almost nothing. The only issue I have with these sunglasses is that the frame lets in too much light. I have the previous generation Twenty with the solid black frame in which I was comparing these to.. The only way to get the new polarized version is to get the crystal frameset, as there is no option for a solid black frame with the polarized lenses. I will be returning these to wait for a solid frame, if it never comes I suppose I can purchase the polarized lenses to replace my old beat-up ones, if they fit correctly. All in all, great quality, but I do not like how much light comes in when the sun is blaring, especially since I experience light sensitivity. If not for the high quality of the frame, I would have rated these as two star.FYI, my first pair had two defects in the left lens (while looking through them). The defects looked like dust particles had gotten stuck in the iridium coating, so look closely at your lenses inside and out.', 710: 'When I saw this on the store I fell in love with the design. it looks descent and sporty look. I seldom used it because it is my favorite and I dont want to scratch the lense. How it hug on my face really makes an elegant feel.While I use it when we play golf, I didnt realise how hot it was inside my eyes. It sweats alot and I have to constantly wipe the sweat off on my eyes. Also in the long use, it feels so heavy on my nose, also the temple slowly digs in at the back of my head, which I constatly removed since it is giving me a headache.After that Experience, also notice that it is too near to my eyes that my eyelashes always touch the lense.And most of all, the design of the short temple is not good. It scratches my polarized black iridium lense! I have to put a rubber band to keep the temple away to the lense when I store it on my case. Now Both of my lense has a scratch. I havent bought a replacement lense yet,Good fit sunglass if the weather is cold. I suggest dont use it on hot weather.And watch out for that temple sratching your lense.

I had been using polarized glasses before so I did not order the polarized. Its good if youre fishing, youre a cop or on job duty. It helps a little to see thru glass barrier.Good enough styling.

What I notice most frequently is that the stems press against the spot above each ear to such an extent that it gives me a headache. Also, when the eyeglasses are seated correctly on my face, the frames cut off all airflow, which means that the glasses get condensation on the interior of the lenses. That closeness also means that eyelashes brush up against the lenses... not good if you're wearing mascara. (The lenses, by the way, are rather ordinary plastic but have no distortions.)

I tried returning these and of course the 30 day return policy is past, but you would think you should be able to have some type of service warranty for glasses that cost $160.  Keep your money and buy something reputable from a department store were you can have service for something you would most likely use every sunny day.\", 773: 'I believe I have a slightly above average sized head. I don\\'t know if that contributes to any of the minor issues I have with the glasses, but they are as follows:1) The nose pads are uneven. They are not aligned properly. This causes one pad to \"carry\" more weight and leaves a larger, more pronounced nose pad spot after wear. Which is another problem, they leave horrendous nose pad marks. I don\\'t even push them on.2) One of the legs gets so ridiculously loose that I\\'ve resorted to tightening it and never folding the leg. I think the freaking thing would fall of given enough time.3) The warm grey lens is just a little too light for summer days in Florida. I find myself squinting to a degree I don\\'t have to when wearing my other high end pair of sunglasses.4) Having a slightly larger than average head, the wrap on these isn\\'t as good as I\\'d like. On very sunny days it can certainly begin to take its toll.Conclusion: It may sound as if I hate the things but I don\\'t. I just don\\'t think they\\'re cut out for my kind of use or head shape. The issues with the leg and nose pads I\\'m sure are unique to me and not a reflection of the model itself.', 774: \"Traducci&oacute;nGood morning, I'm very upset it's been a month of buying my glasses, and was not delivered, the tracking number they gave me does not work, I need you to answer for my glasses because they are need answer for my glasses because they are of a high value, please  not ignore this message\", 775: 'My order was for Polished Chrome/VR28 Black Iridium but I got Polished Chrome Frame/Vr28 Black Lens.This is totally not acceptable, how can I have a replacement?', 776: 'Didnt like very much, fits big heads really wide ones nicely!

It was obvious it was not what should be with a $170 brand new pair of glasses. The worst part is whomever filled the order had to know they were screwing me over. I suspect there is a good chance that the glasses themselves were used, but there are no scratches to prove this.

I'm still waiting on customer service to get back to me over a week later and I really do not want another pair of these glasses.

It says that if you tamper with or break the seal, no refund is possible.  Did you want to see what these glasses look like on you before you own them?  At $111.00, I'm guessing the answer is yes.  The seller thinks otherwise.  They've never heard of people wanting to try on glasses and will make you pay full price just for looking.  Obviously did not open the, tamper with, or alter the seal on the box, just returned them as delivered and wrote a flaming review to save you all the trouble of same experience.

I decided to try them out.  Oakley has a strong reputation for active sunglasses that can sustain drops, scratches, etc.  The glasses are extremely light and made out of a very cheap black plastic.  I was almost scared put them on and off my head because they don't stretch much.  I expected much more for an Oakley frame that costs around $140 retail.  Almost beware of this seller, the box that the Oakley's came in was all scratched up, stickers (3rd party stickers) all over it, the materials inside look like they have been used or opened before.

I paid the tag price of $120.00 same as my last pair which i purchased at sunglass hut however while holding both of these in my hand, its VERY obvious that these are a knock off pair.

Oakley lists them as NEW and no one in my area has them on display yet. Unfortunately, the picture does them more justice. Oakley's site pictured them more as a matte finish, almost like an oil rubbed bronze with a lighter color inside. There are no dimensions printed for these yet which also hindered our purchase. Upon receiving them today, they are glossy brown with a brown and light pink tortoise shell interior. They still look good, just not what we expected. Our biggest dissapointment (which gives them 2 stars) is the lens. They are not dark at all. I consider these a fashion lens and not a performance lens. We were hoping for sunglasses to be worn mainly outdoors in the bright sun. It is 12:50 in the afternoon and no lights on in the house, only natural light from the windows and her eyes are very visible through the lenses. Take it as you will...great beach sunglasses for single women, if you are married and dont want your husband to know you are checking out the guys, find darker lenses! As for size, I would classify them as a medium/large. My girlfriend has wider temples and these fit fine, whereas regular sunglasses are snug. She also has higher cheek bones and these do rub her cheeks when she smiles.In conclusion, these are great sunglasses. Very high quality. Gloss brown, brown and pink tortoise shell interior, lightly tinted bronze polorized lens, medium/large size, fashion sunglasses. Had the lenses been darker, they would have been 5 star.\", 807: 'I have wide face with high cheek bone,so this glass was sitting on my face istead of my nose.

The seller sent the glasses USPS signature required, so it took me a long time to get them and I have to drive to pick them up.  Funny, I drove right past a running store with the same product at a lower price to get to the post office.  The glasses are great, it just took a long time to get them and I had to pick them up', 810: 'I am somewhat skeptical that this was not a truly new pair of Oakleys.

Great for athletic activities and they wrap around your face comfortably without jostling in the middle of a run.\", 818: \"I received the Revo Metallic Red Graphite Polarized Sunglasses as a gift.  I loved the styling and their wrap-around design.  the glasses seemed to ride higher on the bridge of my nose than most other glasses -felt too small.  The polarized lenses had one big drawback: they filtered out certain colors on my car's GPS navigation display making it very difficult to read the display without raising the glasses.  Polarization usually filters out magenta and some other reds.\", 819: 'Upon first receiving these glasses they were the best sunglasses that I have ever had (I had several pairs of Oakleys before this). I really like the color contrast and other differences between the two brands. However after a few months, the lenses showed signs of wear on the inside of the lenses from rubbing against my hair (streaks/lines on the tint not scratches). I called into customer service and my product was not covered under warranty because the vendor was not an \"authorized\" vendor (you might want to check with the vendor before making your purchase). That\\'s fine with me. I\\'ve purchased replacement lenses for pairs of Oakley\\'s at $80 a pair several times and never thought twice about it. So I asked to order a pair of lenses and they said no. They require you to send them your glasses and for them to replace the lenses for you. I eventually convinced them to sell the lenses to me and mail them to me directly, but they have been on back order for the last 3 months so I still don\\'t have new lenses. If I had sent them my glasses, they would still have my glasses and I would have had to buy another pair to wear.I won\\'t buy another pair of Revo\\'s. I want to know that I can get parts for my glasses and be able to repair them myself in a timely fashion. I\\'ll be buying Oakley the next time I need to replace my lenses.', 820: \"I purchased these because they are a REVO product, and many years ago I had some excellent REVO glass lens sunglasses that set contrast beautifully, and were super sharp in a quality frame.  This is a case of not seeing a product before receiving it.  First off, I ordered REVO  (which I got) but the product shipping material all said I was getting Oakley Chasm, which I didn't want.  I don't know why the discrepancy.  What you get is a cheap set of plastic lenses in a cheap, matt black, frame that just fits O.K.  Basiscally your corner drugstore sunglasses for far too much money. I kept mine, but they are back up glasses now.\", 821: 'Too bad that Revo decided to stop producing the glass lenses. I liked the heavy feel. Just being super careful with these since they are so light.No other concers.', 822: \"These glasses are Revo Discerns not Oakley, and what is up with the straight frames (the part that goes over your ears) ? If you wear these type of glasses with a hat, the hat band and frames interfere with one another. Also - I had a pair of Revos for 10 years with glass frames, these are polycarb, which will wear out much faster.Update (8/17/2013)After having these for the full summer and attempting to wear these things at two all day outdoor events (a baseball game and an airshow) I have decided update my review.These glasses have that G-Unit/X-Generation/Super Jock straight frame design that I have never been comfortable with and if you want to wear a hat and are out in the sun all day, it is a real hassle, I found myself constantly trying to either put the frames under the hatband or over it all day long (with neither being comfortable), the lenses also ride right on your skin on the bridge of your nose and the oil/sweat creates the most horrible annoying film that seems next to impossible to get off these things, I even bought a special lens spray and cloth but I would have had to carry it all day because it happens almost immediately , it was the most annoying experience I have ever had with sunglasses. I also wore them to a baseball game and discovered the optics are HORRIBLE I could not even see the ball being pitched when I wore them.I have 5 pair of sunglasses currently, ranging from $20 Performance Bike riding glasses all the way up to Costco Serengeti's - none that I was too happy with due to the plastic frames and I bought these because the last pair of Revos I had were the best glasses I ever put on, and I decided to take a chance on these in buying online. I think we owe  Oakley a big thank you for ruining a perfectly good product - DO NOT BUY THESE GLASSES. Try Maui Jim - they still make glass lenses and the optics are much better.UPDATE: 6/21/2014 These lenses have started to scratch on the INSIDE, there is no possible way I would have scratched them in the area they are scratched. I always keep them in the case and do not wear them that often. I believe the plastic coating is wearing off the lenses, the old Revos were glass lenses with the coating on the inside, there are just cheap plastic lenses. Don't bother buying these you are wasting your money.\", 823: 'I bought a pair of these from this company a year ago. 3 months later the polarization began to seperate from the inside of both lenses. So I mailed them back to Revo with the original receipt and box from amazon. Revo then informed me that Affordable Luxury Is not a AUTHORIZED REVO DEALER and that infact my glasses were KNOCK OFF\\'S Hence voiding any warranty through them. So I then tried to contact Affordable Luxury about this issue to no avail.Meaning after explaining what had happened in full On several e-mail attempts I recieved no reply. I have since repurchased this same style at my local SUNGLASS HUT Who is a Authorized Revo dealer. About 80 bucks more but well worth it to own the \"REAL DEAL\" that comes with a full warranty. These glasses are fantastic, I could definitely tell the difference in the quality of the lenses from the first pair.The clarity is amazing it is like HD and the frames are so light you sometimes forget you are wearing them. You will not be disappointed.

The label on the box matched what I ordered, but the actual lenses have a warm tint, definitely not the black iridium polarized lenses as described (I have two other Oakleys with black iridium polarized lenses, and those have no color tint).. They are polarized though. My best guess is they are maybe a bronze polarized or something. The accompanying photo is pretty accurate of the color tint, although the lenses are darker than the photo suggests. The silver frame looks just like silver paint... it's not a sexy looking chrome frame or anything.Overall, for half price I'm satisfied. They are comfortable, light and have high optical quality.\", 830: \"Its true that these are super light weight but the construction is so flimsy.Mine came and does not fit evenly on my face.

Admittedly, I travel a lot (130K miles this year & counting) but this item didn't even last six months.  Specifically, the handle no longer works (the handle won't rise making it next to impossible to do anything but carry the bag).  I liked the styling and the size of the bag but the quality is completely unacceptable.  My advice, save your money and make a different selection!\", 833: \"Well, it's divided in two and therefore a lot of storage/jamming function is lost. I'd say it only packs about 40% of the quantity that an undivided compartment style can. As I need to carry more than one pair of trousers and two shirts plus underwear and socks, it does not work for me. It would, however, work well for an overnighter. But that's something I don't do.\", 834: \"I was expecting more from this bag. On the one hand it delivers what it promises, a gimmicky backpack that will stand out from the rest. It looks like it will be a beast of a bag. That is where it falls short. The material appears less than durable. The zippers don't look like they are going to stand up to a lot of use. While a 17&#34; laptop does in fact fit in the laptop compartment, you cannot use the side access to load or unload it. A 15&#34; laptop barely fits through this opening. Because of the lack of rigidity and the less than beefy zippers, it is a two handed process just to zip up the side compartment. The built in case on the top flap is awkward and gets in the way when opening the flap. The three solid metallic D-rings near the bottom of the pack are for decoration only as they are attached to a thin plastic panel on the other side of the material. There is absolutely no rigidity to this bag at all. It will not stand up on its own when set down unless it is completely full. It does hold a ton of gear in the one main compartment however, access is cumbersome since the flap gets in the way it is difficult to access all of the unorganized gear inside. Even access to the front accessory compartment requires that you unclip the top flap.Conclusion: It looks very cool but its performance doesn't stand up to the daily grind.\", 835: \"It's quality is there, but I wished it had more organization qualities. I feel oakley just threw this together with some cool latches and threw their name on it and added a typical Oakley price to it.. Love their glasses, can't say the same about my first Oakley backpack purchase.\", 836: \"I have been using the Kitchen Sink for a while now. It is a cool backpack. I've used it for trade shows, work, and for a light backpacking trip.My conclusion after using it for sometime is that it is overkill and the ease of use leaves much to be desired.If you like the aesthetics it is a great bag. If you are looking for something with a high level of usability there are other available options that might be a better fit.Pros:Looks awesomeCan carry a lotShoe space in the bottom is crucialCons:My large laptop can only be accessed from the topThe storage is not quickly accessibleThe straps are not super comfortable on a long tripI would buy it again but it was not amazing.\", 837: \"The bag is great (looks-wise), the build quality is not.I purchased this from Amazon Export Sales as Xmas present for my 11 year old Son.  We purchased the beige camouflage version of the Men's Kitchen Sink Backpack.Six months later the metal fixing points (the three you can see in the picture) start to come loose and then one falls off. Luckily we staff have the U-shape part and the face-plate that it sits on-top of.  The screws that hold it in place are still inside the backpack as they are in a sealed off area within one of the compartments of the bag and we'd have to cut it open to find and re-affix the screws.Throughout the 6 months my Son used this bag, he has never attached anything to those fixing points, so they've just worked their way loose without any contact in a bag that's only been used to carry school books.I contacted my local Oakley office and they will not provide any assistance - stating they only support products purchased within their region/retail outlets.  This is not the response I expect from Oakley for what is obviously a manufacturing problem.\", 838: \"Oakley.  A great name.  And that is what sells this backpack.  It isn't the design.  Yes it does look cool but functionality wise it lacks alot.  The zippers on the side compartments (L & R) need nursing when you want to close them.  With the weight of the top portion of the backpack, it slouches making the laptop access zipper difficult to use and it too has to be nursed.  The compartments aren't independent and therefor infringe on each other's space restricting overall accessibility-if you have the main compartment stuffed, forget about adding or accessing the compartment behind the 3 aluminum hook points.  The lid always gets in the way when you want to access the main compartment.  The waist strap is pathetic compared to the manly latches holding the lid down (would have expected an aluminum latch across the waist to match).  It is heavy but that really isn't an issue more of a statement.The design was overkill to get the tough/cool look, its just a shame function had to suffer to follow form.\", 839: \"I've had my kitchen sink for almost a year. The zipper in the side access pocket has already torn out making it useless. If you have one keep the bag very straight when unzipping the side pocket.\", 840: \"I needed a Huge backpack for hiking and traveling. This bag is huge and can fit a ton of stuff but it's designed pretty poorly. I expected more from Oakley. The main pocket is one big pocket, which I love. The small side pockets are somewhat awkward and there is no water bottle holder. The smaller zip pocket is located UNDER the large top flap which means that you have to unclip the top flap to access the small pocket. The small pocket also unzips in a downward fashion which can lead to stuff falling out if you're not careful when you open it. The hard covered pocket on the main flap is an awkward shape. It's supposed to be for headphones or sunglasses but it's really just a waste. I don't hate this pack but there's got to be a better one out there for less money. At the very least go to an Oakley store and take a first hand look at it before purchasing it. Looks cool, functions poorly.\", 841: 'I was hoping to find a backpack computer bag that would be as useful and versatile as a Large Alice Pack but fit under an airline seat.  The large metal rings are useless unless you need something to connect snap-links to, so if you are not carrying mountain climbing gear they just look stupid.  The 2 side pockets are OK but I can not close them with one hand.  The front pocket can not be easily accessed without opening the main compartment quick snap-links.  The hardened top pocket is OK until I forget to close it and I open the main flap, everything falls out.  I like Oakley and the pack looks cool but it is not very functional.', 842: 'This bag lasted four months before the stitches started coming out. Oakley is calling it wear and tear and will not warranty their cheap bag. I took it to a seamstress whom had no dog in this fight and she told me it was due to improper sewing of the seams. By the way, I have Walmart 20 dollar bags that have made it longer, so I contend that Oakley knows that this is trash and therefore will not warranty the item.', 843: \"I saw this in the Oakley store and bought it brand new on EBay and was disappointed with how uncomfortable it is. I work overseas so I would use it to travel. I went to the London Airport which is huge and it would be very uncomfortable around the shoulders. I could not adjust them so it would feel comfortable. I also would walk around with my 17 inch Laptop in the back and found the waist straps were cumbersome and useless. Its try difficult to adjust it when you have it on. Im 5'10 and it would sag down on my lower back causing discomfort on my back and on my shoulders. Also disappointing (not that I would buy it again) is that they only make one color. Black although they used to make a grey one but Oakley is very limited on their colors. The design is good for the bag but over long periods of wearing it then it becomes uncomfortable. A lot of pockets but Oakley needs to get better comfort and lighter colors. Its good if your going from your car to class but NOT for extended periods of use. Like over 30 minutes. AVOID AVOID AVOID!\", 844: 'Not good for business functions. Swiss gear backpack is much better as far as organizing papers, computer and various equipment that you carry everyday for work. Outside of the top compartment protection for sensitive items what you are looking at here is just a large cloth bag. I would not recommend it to anyone that needs organizational capabilities. Looks cool though.', 845: \"I use this bag as a gym bag and for my commutes on a motorcycle.  It's a good looking bag with solid stitching.  The older version had vents on the lower panel (common in other oakley bags so it doesn't stink if you put shoes or gym clothes); pockets on the waist strap; metal buckle for the waist strap; and additional media pocket on shoulder strap.  When I got the bag, I thought it was a factory defect b/c it was missing those features.  I checked with oakley and these features were removed to cut production costs.  It is a good bag but its not worth two bills.\", 846: \"Even when empty it's too heavy for every day use and the three metal pieces on the back scratched the back of the seat of the car. On the whole, not a good spend.\", 847: \"The zippers on the bag should be higher quality. I've had OGIO backpacks in the past. The designs are more ergonomics friendly and zippers are easier to use!\", 848: \"bought this a few years ago for 13 yr old son, he used it from 8th grade thru first half of freshman high school. Sturdy and impressively constructed. He liked all the hooks and buckles that it came with, and the hardtop compartment on the top was good for fragile items like sunglasses. However, it was heavy, and opening it was actually a bit clunky - the top flap was not flexible and had to be lifted like a hatch, and then it hung awkwardly towards the back when you were opening the main compartment. Eventually he stopped using the Kitchen SInk even if it wasn't worn out yet, and switched to a slightly lighter-weight Swiss Gear. Now he uses a Timbuk2 Ram convertible messenger/ backpack, and the difference in ease of use/ ergonomic fit is amazing -- and it was much less expensive than the Oakley. For its high price, the Oakley kitchen sink was a nice novelty and status symbol, but it was not a good value.\", 849: \"This backpack is super small compared to what it was advertised. All of the compartments steal their space from other compartments so unless you are master packer, you're going to struggle. It is perfect for small trips and fits easily under the seat in an airplane (what does that tell you). The zipper on the front pocket broke 2 days after I Bought it.... I wouldn't recommend it unless you just want it for the style. The functionality is questionable.\", 850: \"At first I thought I got a knock off of the original Oakley Kitchen Sink Backpack.  But after reading another person's review, it was the &#34;new design&#34;.It was missing the breath hole on the bottom of the bag and there is only one zipper head in the middle front pocket.  So you will need to zip it all the way to the left to close it.  Since the zipper behind the metal hook, it is almost impossible to access the front pocket without unhooking it.Overall it is a solid bag, but the inconvenience when accessing the middle pocket annoys me...\", 851: 'At first this product was great.  But after about 2 months the seems all started falling apart.  After 11 months the bag is in shambles.  I only used it to carry a 13\" laptop, a few cables, and miscellaneous things.  Never overfilled.Steer clear of these oakley bags the seems are JUNK!', 852: 'I purchased this bag in November of 2010. By July 2012 it has come apart at the seems. Although the design and layout is amazing, the quality is not. I carry an 11\" Mac Book Air and an iPad. It was my white collar work brief case. I cannot recommend this bag.I called Oakley Customer Care and they said the bag only has a 30 day warranty.', 853: 'I got this bag as a \"freebie\" using Priority Club points, so the price was right.I\\'ve had it for 2 years. Functionally, I really like it. Lots of compartments for keeping stuff neatly arranged. I wish there were an umbrella and/or a water bottle holder, but that\\'s wish list things.On the downside, after about 18 months the zipper on the computer compartment started falling apart - right as I got through the security line and was trying to put the computer back inside. The compartment has two zipper pulls, so I was able to get it closed back up, but I\\'ve been waiting ever since for the other one to crap out, which it is now starting to do.', 854: 'I travel a lot...and I mean a lot.  I loved the look of this bag and figured it must be \"bombproof\" and purchased this bag for my flights.  Like previous reviews I was underwhelmed with the quality of this bag.  I carried my laptop, ipad and a moleskin notebook in the main pouch and pens and passports in the other pouches.  Not a lot of stuff at all.  The bag started to go first on the handle.  Not only did the grippy material on the handle fray and rip but the actual handle came apart at the seem.  I ended up sewing it back together with dental floss (traveler\\'s secret).  Once this problem was fixed the zipper came apart and would fail to secure the bag, after closer inspection the zipper\\'s seem had also come lose and also had to be sewn back together.The plus:  The bag does not show dirt and the overall look is very cool.  It fits easily under seats and in the overhead bin.  The zippers allow for a full \"clam shell\" open or just enough to get your hands in.  I consider this a huge plus as it helps to prevent your stuff from going everywhere.  The strap is very comfortable.  The pockets make it very easy to organize items in a logical way.The minus:  The sewing and quality control appear to lack.  The strap would adjust itself at strange times and where the bag \"stayed\" on my body was solely dependent on the bags whims.', 855: \"This is a tough briefcase that I bought to replace a beloved REI vertical-loading computer briefcase that was stolen from my car recently. In terms of construction and toughness, it's close to the quality of the REI case (which sadly, is discontinued - thus my search for something similar), similar in price.But there are some design issues where it misses the mark: the loops for pens inside the front compartment are arranged horizontally, which means the pens simply fall out and into the bottom of the compartment. The pockets inside the front compartment seem cheap in terms of quality and construction, compared the main bag, and use velcro where zippers would be expected from a bag in this price range. The eyeglass compartments are fine (one is even lined for eyeglasses), but very small -- so eyeglasses re pretty much the only thing that will fit in there -- don't even think about a place to put a water bottle.The computer compartment works fine, but the bag is just narrow enough that file folders have to go in on end -- and it's very snug, so not a ton of room for bulky stuff. There's also no zip or storage pocket in the computer compartment for cords, plugs, etc.The main feature I miss from the REI bag was an easily accessible place to store essentials within reach: wallet, phone, keys, etc. The main front pocket isn't set up very well for this purpose, and the lower front pocket (with the rubber protector pieces) is too small.Finally, the shoulder strap and handle are excellent and sturdy, but there aren't any skids or feet on the bottom to keep the bag from slipping onto the floor -- sort of a major oversight, though again, I'm comparing this to my trusty, stolen REI briefcase!One pleasant surprise is the very slim pocket above the main front compartment -- this turns out to be a great place to put a tablet computer -- fits an iPad perfectly.So, I give it three star for missing on a few details, considering the price tag. Well-built, but not so well thought out.\", 856: \"Update 9/18/12 - The seller contacted me and offered a return for full refund.  I appreciate the offer, but I actually like the glasses and will be keeping them.  This still does not change the fact that they are not polorized as advertised, but they are Oakleys and they do fit great.  Just make sure to look at the lenses before buying to make sure they say POLORIZED on them if you want polorized ones.  Changed from 1 to 3 stars because of seller trying to fix things.The description of the glasses stated that they were polarized.  Once receiving the glasses I realized that they are not, they are the standard Ten's that are not polarized.  They are still nice glasses to say the least, however it would be nice if the seller did not advertise them as polarized in the description.  After all the return fees and restocking fees it is not even worth returning these so I will keep them.  Just disappointed that the seller falsly advertized the product. I'm only giving the glasses 1 star due to the false advertisement, the quality and fitment of the glasses is great!\", 857: \"I love Oakley sunglasses and have worn them for years. I bought this pair because the last pair had worn out after about five years of nearly constant use. I chose this style because the reviews said they work well for people with big heads and my size 7 5/8 head definitely qualifies. The good news is that they fit like a dream on the sides of my head; not to tight or too loose. What you might not be able to notice about the design is that the bottom of the lens frames are square and have a small lip on the inside and outside of the glasses. Since the frames are designed to wrap around your head, this design actually rests on my cheekbone. There is no place for ventilation except for a small space at the top of the frame. This results in the glasses fogging up when I start to perspire. I've learned that I can make them sit crooked on the bridge of my nose to prevent the fogging and while that looks ridiculous at least I can see the road!\", 858: 'It is one size only.

My only problem with them is that the lenses are SUPER delicate. The lenses are soft like butter and will scratch with a hard look! I've never been so stressed out about a pair of shades. When I go out with them I make sure to bring a case to put them in when not in use. don't carry your keys in the same hand, don't place them in a pocket, don't just leave them on a table when you get home. I've had plenty of nice $100.+ sunglasses but I have to say that this pair although cool looking are not worth the money.\", 875: \"I expected this to be more of a jacket but its really just a sweater.

I purchased this backpack directly from Oakley's website, and when checking all of the pockets/features that the zipper on the front main pocket was not working properly.  After finally getting the zipper to open fully (which took about 3 minutes), I could see lots of fraying of fabric, where the zipper was getting stuck.  It seems that the China factory worker found this zipper sticking on the extra fabric inside the pocket, and instead of trimming that extra fabric off, or pulling the item off the assembly table (since it is defective), they left it as-is.  Now I have to try and remedy this problem by trimming the extra fabric.  I don't think it'll work, since it seems to be a design defect in how the front fabric is sewn together and where they install the zipper.\", 882: 'This pack looks great in images, but for the price it is severely lacking.  I recently got it so I can\\'t speak to durability over time, but materials seem so-so.  What good is a metal handle if connected by 2 thin strips of nylon?  Bag material is okay, but not heavy in any way for padding or elements.  The metal clasps are a joke, large springs open to elements/dirt etc. and easily snaggable.  The shoulder strap clasps are practically decorative and do not detach the straps which are sewn like 99% of every other bp.17\" laptop sticks up almost 2\" past padding so any impact to that upper portion merely has a single layer of material without padding.  Padding in laptop compartment isn\\'t great, but to be fair, almost no pack I\\'ve found does.  If you fill the upper flap areas with any thing rigid you will likely get \\'rubbing\\' on the laptop portion exposed internally.The real disappointment is the lack of small compartments within the larger ones.  Not a pen, 1\" or 2\" elastic loop or pocket anywhere, so pens, keys, cables, adapters filter to the bottom of whichever larger section they are in.  The bottom back does have a key clap, but it is plastic and practically broke just in my finger squeeze.  Particularly the largest area just outside the laptop, just stupid not to have any pockets.This is a really expensive gym clothes backpack.  Probably good for day pack for skiing, day at the beach, but in no way is a true utility pack... Completely a \\'poser\\' pack.For best 17\" laptop, lots of compartments, and much sturdier material, stick to the much cheaper, if not as sheik looking, Swissgear IBex backpack.', 883: \"The Red Iridium Polarized lenses are not dark enough for my application and really don't look great with black frames.

These boots are not made in the USA unfortunately. The tan colored version issued to certain branches of the military are made in the USA, and I would guess that they are of better quality. In the past I have worn Danner, Rocky and Lowa.

The last time I wore them was during a 17km forced march and the heel cup blew open, I finished the march with my socks and boots soaked in blood.They are nice and light weight though, had a nice running shoe type feel.

About 3 months after the waranty was up (one year warranty), the plastic hinge snapped on the glasses for no reason. I didn't really think it was a big deal at the time, cause it was a little plastic part that did not seem hard to replace and I figured a quick call to oakley would get the part shipped to me. The problem though is that they have discontinued these glasses and went ahead and destroyed all the replacement parts for them in the event someone wanted to fix their glasses. There is literally no way to get a replacement hinge for these without ordering a new pair of glasses either off of amazon or ebay. Oakley thought it would be sufficient to give me a 35% off coupon to order a new pair of $280 that they replaced mine with. How long until those ones are discontinued though? All in all, I really enjoyed these glasses, and I am quite bitter that I cannot get them fixed.

Bought a pair of these, loved every minute of wearing them.  Kept them in very good shape and loved how the brown lenses looked on the golf course.However...  The hinged pieces that connect the frame together are a HORRIBLE design.  When you put them on, you inherently spread them apart to go on your head.  This causes the plastic pieces to bend.  As you can imagine, over time this weakens the plastic.  My first pair lasted about 10 months before they broke (I wore them pretty much every day).  Replaced them and the same thing happened in 5 months.  By then I had no more warranty and they don't produce them anymore.  I was out of luck.  Guess that's why they decided to nix them from thier lineup.Overall the quality of the glasses is good with the aluminum frames and I loved the lenses.  However, the connection piece is garbage and will fail over time.  No way around it.Avoid buying these without seeing them first and you'll understand.  I knew when I bought them it would proabably end up costing me, and it did.\", 908: 'I would rate the service A+.  However the description said polarized and they were not.

Oakley's were always my go to glasses, as I love their wire frame design, great lenses and extreme durability.

I did not use these glasses long enough to comment on the quality of lenses, as I returned them back to amazon shortly after receiving them.As an Oakley fan, I hope my bad experience with this product is just a one-off, maybe due to bad design rather than it being an indication that the quality of Oakley has diminished since it was sold off.  And what is the deal with Oakley not packaging a sunglass case with their glasses,  I know they were able to get away with it in the past, maybe due to lack of competition, but they are no longer the only company in their market segment, and their competitors all seem to provide a case.\", 917: 'Nice glasses but to tight on the face ...pinches ears as well ..could be my head but at $250.00 or more ..check itout in stores if at all possible !', 918: 'These glasses look very nice and elegant.

The rest of the sunglasses where ok.\", 921: \"Bought these directly from Oakley website (so no question of getting fake or plastic as others have mentioned here). However, these glasses are poorly made and Oakley should not have sold them with a major flaw on how the frames (temple rods or stems) are designed. I loved these glasses when they first arrived. Looked stylish, the optics was good and overall I got it for a good price. I have 3-4 pairs (Ray-bans, Persol etc.) which I rotate and use so I've not used these everyday or handled roughly. After about 3 months of very light use the temples (hinged stem connected to the side of the rim - [...] have come apart. Its because of a major design flaw. If you see the photos closely (I have Matte Black Frame/Black Iridium Lens) you can see the temples are actually two pieces and its basically one metal piece inserted into another. There isn't any real protection from these coming out and once they come out you can't put them back and make it one piece again. Such a disappointment. I have no idea why Oakley would use two metal pieces to make a temple when clearly most other frames just use one single piece.Another con is that you don't get a case to store these glasses which will protect it. All you get is a cloth sack which is also in the pictures. For a product that retails for $200 this is ridiculous. Save your money and buy quality eye-wear of some other brand which isn't spending all the money on marketing and brand ambassadors, but on quality design and manufacturing (which is tough since Luxottica pretty much owns everything now).\", 922: 'Bought it from Amazon.com.

They told me to take it in to an Oakley Store and after discussions they came forward and told these were display models that they kept in in their showcases and the Original consumer models were made of C-5 metal in the US.So its better of going to the store and getting the metal frame if you are planning on paying so much for it.', 923: 'In the decription says that are metal sunglasses, but the pair that was sent to me are made of plastic...looks like any cheaper sunglasses...', 924: \"Over all, you can't go wrong with Oakley.

What I got was less than that. The arms have some semi sloppy hinges that are annoying. It doesn't affect anything while wearing them, but I noticed it immediately after unboxing these. The next issue is about scratching the lenses. I've had the Straight Jackets for over 2 years and have only one teeny little scratch that you have to know about to see. These Pit Bulls have several visible scratches after only a couple months. There are 3 possibilities for this, and it could be any of them. 1) I just got really unlucky about getting scratches so quickly. 2) The lenses are of lesser quality and simply scratch easier. 3) The larger size of the lenses may expose more of the curve past the frames, making it more vulnerable to contact.The scratching issue is a neutral topic that would be unfair of me to subtract stars about, given that I have no proof the lenses are of lesser quality. However for $190, the jiggly sloppy arm hinges are inexcusable. For that kind of money, and with the Oakley reputation, these should have never made it past the QA dept.

This is a very sad day for Oakley and every employee within earshot of our conversation had something negative to say about their company's move to China.  You would think that a solid U.S. brand like this, who demands a high price, would maintain their MADE IN THE U.S.A production.

I know this is the current fashion, but come on...Also, the frames were not so well-made: the arms were about as loose (with up/down play at the hinges) as those on my three-year old Straight Jackets.

Seems like Oakley dropped the ball with the Fast Jackets.\", 1030: \"I have been a huge Oakley customer the past 10 years of my life, until I purchased this pair of sunglasses.  I actually already owned another pair of Fast Jackets, and I purchased these just to save some effort in terms of switching lenses for a particular light condition.When this pair arrived, there was a distinct difference in fit and quality.  Typically Oakley was rugged and felt like a quality item in one's hand.  This pair felt like a cheap pair of sunglasses pulled off the rack at some backwater gas station.  As to the fit, I made a direct comparison to my other Fast Jackets.  This pair was so eschew it was laughable.I got to examining further and could not find the classic &#34;Made in USA&#34; on the ear stem.  Eureka, perhaps I had somehow acquired a counterfeit pair (although I recall the order was straight from Amazon, and I doubted Amazon would deal in counterfeit goods).  Being an Oakley aficionado at the time, I decided to make a call to Oakley headquarters to discuss the matter.Oakley informed me that they have now transferred production overseas.  I was given the same typical bilge along the lines of &#34;every item made overseas meets the exacting standards that Oakley established here in North America.&#34;  Yeah, sure.  If Oakley stands behind its Chinese manufacturing, then it should proudly stamp &#34;Made in China&#34; on the ear stem like it did with its &#34;Made in USA.&#34;  Moreover, as already mentioned, these Chinese Fast Jackets stuck out like a sore thumb of shoddy manufacturing.  Sorry Oakley, injection molding of plastics should not be entrusted to child slave labor.  Last, just how stupid have we become as American consumers?  Too often, consumers accept as fact lies along the lines of &#34;companies have to go overseas to make ends meet and keep prices down.&#34;  Um, these crap Chinese Oakley Fast Jackets cost the same amount as my high quality made in USA pair.  Besides, I have no problem paying a premium for American goods.  You hear that corporate America?  Here is somebody willing to pay for what he wants.  Get your head in the game and offer me some products.As angry as I am with this development, my prevailing emotion is despondency.  Oakley was an American institution and something I was proud to wear.  I ended up hawking all my Oakleys on ebay while they still have resale value.  It won't be long before Oakley will go the way of other luxury goods like Coach purses.  The quality and prices will drop, and soon, every rube in the country will own them.  Congratulations on destroying your brands, brainiacs.In the meantime, if you are looking for a high quality pair of sunglasses, I suggest you check out Rudy Project.  As of this writing, Rudy Project manufacturers in Italy and, gasp, actually has lower prices than Chi-Com manufactured Oakleys.\", 1031: \"I  am not sure this is Amazon's fault, but the lenses that came with my sunglasses are NOT polarized.

I had to pay an extra $80 to get polarized lenses from the Oakley website.\", 1032: \"While Oakley attempts to be a premium brand their glasses are functional but not premium, and therefore overpriced. There is lots of gimmickery with casing and exchange lenses, but they are plastic and flimsy.

I purchased the first pair at a retail store and the second pair was ordered directly from Oakley's custom shop.  When this pair arrived they looked ok at first glance.  However once I opened the box, I immediately recognized that they were a cheap knockoff.  There are numerous differences between these and and genuine Oakley sunglasses.  The case is inferior, the microfiber bag is wrong (real one has pockets for the spare lenses), the lens release latch does not fit properly, the frames are flimsy and most importantly, the lenses are terrible.  And, just for the record, the fake lenses do not fit in either of my authentic Oakley Fast Jacket XL frames.  For those of you that are raving about how much you like these imitation sunglasses, I encourage you to go to an authorized Oakley dealer and see the huge difference in the quality.I would like to point out one last thing.  The seller that I purchased my glasses from immediately sent me a prepaid return mailing label and has returned my money.  They did not seem to know that their supplier was selling them knockoffs and they were understandably upset.  They were very sorry for the mistake and handled the error brilliantly.\", 1036: \"At first these were great glasses but with time the rubber on the sides start to get gummy, and eventually start ripping.  Too bad underneath wasn't just normal size with this rubber added on top of it, that way when the rubber gives out you can just cut it off and wear the shades as regular, instead underneath is skinny and odd looking.  These replaced a pair of monster dogs I lost, im going back to the monster dogs.  The rubber is just the weak link in these otherwise good glasses.\", 1037: \"I like the look of these glasses, but unfortunately, the screw holding in the right lens broke and now it's outside the warranty period. For $100 sunglasses, I would expect something **far** more resilient than these have been.If you like the look of aviators, great - but for as much life as these have, I'd rather spend $20 than $100.Edit: I called Oakley to ask for warranty service. They have a one-year warranty policy and you have to buy full-price from an authorized retailer to qualify. The rep gave me flack for buying from Amazon, which he said at first wasn't an authorized dealer - then he said I wouldn't have qualified anyway because Amazon sells these glasses at a discount.My advice?

The other big compartment is a pain to access, due to the small flap that hides the zipper being too tight.  The small pocket is too small.

This beautiful pack didn't even make it to mid term.  Lots of little fray points at the base of it, the sides.  Lockers were bigger in my day! On the other hand, let's be honest now; if it had gotten normal use, i.e.: not tossed in and out of cars, thrown on floors, shoved into lockers, dragged across halls, banged into walls, doors, and over zealous suitors...it probably would have been fine.

No half number for these, so I ordered size 10. These are really looking good sandals, but, at least with me, both fitted to tight, despite being half a number bigger of my regular size.

When he puts on the sandals, there is one inch of space left between his toes and the front of the sandal, but his heel is exactly at the end of the sandal (I bought a size bigger). His instep is normal, so I believe that it's a design flaw. He also experienced pain in his instep, He usually wears Quiksilver and Reef and never had this problem before.\", 1088: \"Worst sandals ever. They didn't fit right. They might have been defective.

The quality of the shoe looked poorly put together with unfinished edges and thin flaps of leather (the tongues).  The shoe was light and fit too snugly.

VERY DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING ADVERTISING (not to mention frustrating and time wasting)!My only reason for not giving these shoes a single star rating is because they seem to be nicely constructed and I believe if they had been the size I needed they would have been very comfortable and lived up to their claims.', 1119: \"I bought what I paid for. I like the concept but it was poorly done. They are light and they do look spiffy. However, I ordered size 14 wide. Got them and tried to wear them. Oakley's sizes are at least a full size smaller than normal USA sneaker size. After I got them I did some more research and it seems that Oakley doesn't make these in WIDE. Shame on seller for advertising as such. The tongue cups to the ankle so it will never lay flat or even. Upgrade the laces. And I'm quite sure they're made of pig leather. I might have kept them if they had fit right. So with that hopefully you'll be able to purchase the right LSAs for you. But I wouldn't advise spending over $65 for them unless the Oakley symbol is worth that much more to you.\", 1120: \"The boot is very light. The boot breathes easily due to it's light weight design. The only thing that could be fixed is the tread. It's very shallow and slips easily in muddy and rocky terrain. The boot is fine for FOB and urban operations, but not really suited for the field because of this reason.\", 1121: \"I was looking for a lightweight, awesome looking boot for hiking, rucking, etc. I am a minimal footwear guy, and the minimal heel drop and light weight appealed to me. I also wanted to look cool in them.First the good: They are light weight, they drain water perfectly, they fit well. They look super cool. You will feel like an operator in these, even though you are probably not one.The Bad: If you order these boots... please keep this in mind... and you know this, but seriously... keep it in mind. You are buying a pair of boots that have a bunch of holes in the bottom of them. There is no magical one way valve, there are little screens to keep out big stuff, but other than that anything you step on is going into the boot. Mud, sand, water, vomit, radioactive sludge etc.  They dry out really fast, and that's a good thing because they get your socks soggy and covered in mud instantly. I can't imagine how they do in sand.Also, they have nothing inside of them to keep the leather seams etc, from rubbing on your ankles and feet. Mine are super comfy to walk around in, but after a 10mile ruck, I had nice fat gashes/blisters under both of my ankle bones that corresponded exactly with the leather pieces inside the shoe. No bueno. Also the laces are crap. They get all twisted and what not.I am sure they are great if you are going to use them with flippers and invade a swamp somewhere, but if you are planning on hiking around in them and want to keep your feet dry and dirt free, you might want a pair that doesn't have holes in the bottom, and some protection for your ankle skin.\", 1122: \"Why do you show oakley golf shoes that you can not get in 2E or 3E they only have two golf shoes that come in wide. I had to return my Blast golf shoe and found out they don't have them any more and had to settle for a different shoe and and go a size longer because they don't make a 2E or 3E and yet you still advertise them. I could get my money back. People that have wide feet are out of luck for a lot of shoe manufacter, very body are to regular size I guess.  I do say that oakley service did what they could do and was very nice about it.\", 1123: \"I really liked the shoe.. it looked pretty good and could probably be very comfortable as well.

Then in Oct of 2012, as I took the glasses off my face the rubber ear extension popped off.  As easily as it snapped out I assumed it would snap back in.  Nope, they were beyond repair, unless I felt the need to squirt super glue all over my $180 sunglasses.  Thankfully, either Oakley or Sunglass Hut offer a 1-yr full replacement.

So for styling I would rate these a 4, maybe 5.A few weeks after I bought them one of the icons, a soft rubbery plastic, split and died.  One of the ear socks slipped off and disappeared.  All the others are fine.  Over three months ago I reported this to my doctor's office and expected replacements in a week or two.  The doctor's office staff, and even the doctor, have followed up their order with Oakly but the items remain back ordered.

Anyway, a few months in one of these inserts began to break and split. If it falls it will completely ruined the look of the eyeglasses (exposing the frame and losing symmetry unless you destroy the other one too). So I had to glue it together before it grew further damaged.But the worst part are the rubber earsocks. Sure, they look good and offer some (mild) cushion, but they are easily removable. Sooner or later (in my case, sooner) the unavoidable WILL happen and they will fall off. One day I simply realized one of my earsocks was missing! I had to remove the other one just to preserve symmetry but It's unacceptable that such an expensive model has these flimsy components. Worst of all, I contacted the authorized distributor (optic store) where I purchased them, and even contacted Oakley directly. It is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate the red tape and order a replacement pair of earsocks.The eyeglasses themselves are handsome, sturdy, stylish and comfortable.

It is a company in France that makes most of the expensive sun glasses.\", 1289: 'Like one other review stated, these are great for those with smaller faces, in comparison to the Flak Jacket XLJs which I also tried. The lenses are noticeably smaller than the FJ lenses, which looked way out of proportion to my smaller face (I like shape of the larger XL/XLJ lenses though). There IS more coverage than the original Half Jackets though, and its shape is more square, so it hugs my temples lightly, whereas the original HJs did not.One thing I noticed in comparison as well to the pricier models is the lack of \"snappy\" hinges/arms that sort of lock into place to an either completely open or completely closed position. But that shouldn\\'t matter too much.It\\'s a very lightweight and high quality pair of sunglasses. Can\\'t wait to wear on bike rides and runs!Also, the polished black/black iridium pair are currently at an outstanding price point!Edit: My right lens was abnormally loose. It would move if I was putting on the sunglasses by holding the bottom of the lens and top of the frame. It also popped out significantly easier than the left lens, and especially in comparison to my pair of Flak Jackets. I returned these because they felt too cheap in terms of build quality.', 1290: \"I've owned quite a few expensive pairs of sunglasses over the years.  This is my second pair of lenses for these half jacket frames.1.  The lenses on these glasses are far too easy to scratch.  My regular glasses have taken ten times the abuse and then some of these and I have yet to scratch them.2.  The coating on all the iridium series is horrid.  I've had the latest pair a little over three weeks and while wiping smudges off yesterday, the coating started coming off on my shirt.  It was pretty easy to notice because it left large black iridium smudges on the front of the white shirt I was wearing in the office and one of the lenses had an obvious spot where the coating was missing.  The other seems to be fine for now.  Not that it matters.3.  The shape of most Oakley sunglasses will not allow them to be folded and stored in anything except their own gigantic cases.4.  The polarization on these lenses is FAR from the highest quality out there.  Ray-Ban has always been my preferred sunglasses for polarized lenses.5.  The frames fit poorly on anyone with a large or small head.6.  The nose pieces will come off without notice.  If you don't pay attention you will lose them.If I could score these glasses no stars I would.  They are pathetic.  Anyone who rates these high has no idea what a high quality pair of sunglasses is supposed to be like.  The only thing these will be used for by me from now on is I will replace the lenses with clear ones and use them for safety glasses.  That's about all they are good for.\", 1291: \"These are my first pair of oakley's. They are extremely comfortable and look great, but to my disappointment they are not polarized as it says. Hopefully amazon will fix this. Returning and getting polarized version.\", 1292: 'I ordered the Oakley Men\\'s Half Jacket 2.0 XL\\'s. When I opened the box I found I had received another \"Oakley\" model.  The glasses I received are not in the Oakley Half Jacket line in any way.  They came in Oakley packaging.  However, when I went to the Oakley website to try to identify the product I had received I was unable to find any sunglasses on their website that matched those shipped to me.  I returned the incorrect sunglasses the next day and found Amazons return procedures to be excellent.', 1293: \"Oakley is a great brand of sport sun glasses. I'm not writing a review knocking Oakley. These glasses looked like great Sunglasses.The problem was that they are children size sun glasses. I have three Brothers and my Cousin here and we are all adults. These glasses did not fit any of us. I don't think they would fit a petite Women's Face. So this is my review. The end. Actually not the end. It really bothers me that I am willing to spend the money but end up being completely inconvenienced because some Bozo is trying to off some left over eye wear that can't be sold. Throw them on Amazon and cross your Fingers that they sell??? Stop wasting my time!!!The good thing is that Amazon always has your Back in these unfortunate cases. Thank you Amazon for your return policy.\", 1294: 'I have been waiting for over a month for the Oakleys to come it. i getting really tired of waiting...', 1295: 'I bought a custom pair of these glasses $180.00 and the lenses had dimples in them I did not want to send them in them they started breaking by the nose piece because the only thing that hold the lenses in is a little bit of lens by the nose. I contacted Oakley filled out their paperwork and sent them pictures they told me they would reply back to me in five business day but didnt so I called and they said they can send me new lenses for $55.00!! WTF I just send $180.00 never again!', 1296: \"I received my order today and there were two labels on BOTH sides of the box, sealed, that said &#34;THIS ITEM CANNOT BE RETURNED IF THIS LABEL IS TAMPERED OR REMOVED&#34; This is nonsense. If the sunglasses were damaged or broken after I open the label, I can't return it? That is nonsense. I opened the box and the packaging for the sunglasses was very bad. There was only one small piece of plastic protecting ONE leg of the sunglasses. I spend $115 dollars for junk. I will not be buying anything from  Dexclusive again. Oakley is a good brand name, and it worries me that such a big company would have such poor packaging. I am doubting if this is really Oakley or if its fake.\", 1297: 'They are good sunglasses, I just wish they was a little bigger. They are a little snug around my head.', 1298: 'I open the amazon packaging and the Oakley box inside looked as though it has been opened.  Inside someone tried to pass off a gas station knockoffs for authentic Oakley products.', 1299: 'I have a pair of Nike shades similar that i like better.  these do fit snug.  feels weird when wearing hat because the ear piece will sometimes touch hat and make nose piece rise.  it might be my head shape or the way i wear a hat possibly.  the extra nose piece i assume that you just pull of the old and put the new on.  i am afraid to yank the old one off since they are so expensive and them tell me this is not the way its done.  there were no instructions on replacing nose piece if that is what it is.', 1300: 'It was as described but once I put them on they were too small.  I returned them for a refund.', 1301: 'I received the Oakley Half Jacket 2.0 XL sunglasses instead of the Half Jacket 2.0, which is what I ordered.

I am returning them immediately.', 1302: 'Bought this as a gift and influenced by the discount of $20 off.Feels lighter and plasticky compared to the older model which I have.Edges of the lens coating also seems to have peeled off when removed.Note that the older half jacket lens and the lenses from 2.0 are DIFFERENT (new model is larger).Nonetheless, a good quality lens and construction given the price.Took 2 weeks to dispatch for overseas posting - buyers may like to take note.', 1303: 'They are just ok, not great nor terrible, just ok. I did not like there is no hard case, they only come with the bag and as well the silver looks a bit cheap to me further than that this product is just ok', 1304: 'it oakley so it is still good quality but i feel like my 8 year old oakleys feel more comfortable on my face than these', 1305: 'These cool shades are too small for my face for which I had to make a return of this product.', 1306: 'My husband wears Oakleys all the time, so I ordered these for him. They fit much smaller than his original Half Jacket. He looks s if he is wearing child size sunglasses. They mustbe returned.', 1307: 'Not what I expected........but they were the cheapest pair I looked at.........$119 cheap I mean probably give them away to a nephew?', 1308: \"Now the product is great. But Amazon is the wrong place to buy it. Options are not clear. I bought an XL shape glass, and I got an Oval shape. They way options are presented isn't clear, making mistakes in ordering easy.The title of the product includes all the possible keywords and configuration making the ordering confusing. I suggest that you get the glasses from a store that shows options clearly separated, so that you know what you are getting, and do not end up with something you didn't want.\", 1309: 'Its tough buying sunglasses online without trying them on, and its always a risk.  I hate plastic frame sunglasses because I always break them.  You sit on them or they get caught on something, or the earpiece gets tweaked and you are done!  I gave up on Ray Bans because I would always wear out and snap off the earpieces simply taking them off and on so much.  I work outdoors and loved my Oakley Juliet X metal glasses with interchangeable lenses, metal frames and replacement parts.  They lasted forever until I lost them, and since they appear to be out of production, you can easily pay anywhere from $300 to $500 for them.  I liked the look/style of these, as I am getting more picky with my sunglasses and hate a lot of the new styles for men.  I\\'m giving the plastic Oakley\\'s a chance, but I am not optimistic.  They are very lightweight and feel very cheap, like any other pair of $10 sunglasses you would get made in China.  I really worry about the temple area which is always a stress point.  My big complaint is these are small and while they give okay eye coverage (not great coverage), they look really small on my face, almost like I am wearing kids sunglasses.  They are comfortable, and the lenses are okay (not too dark)..see below.  The lenses on these reflect back slightly, with a little mirror to them.  These also don\\'t have the big bulgy horn on the side of the earpiece like the other Half Jacket styles.  The peripheral vision is good, not much obstruction.  I just bought replacement lenses for my \"back up\" pair of glasses, otherwise, I would have probably rotated these into the back up position.  $150 for plastic glasses is crazy.  I don\\'t recall any notation that they were some kind of super strength ultra lightweight plastic....  I think what I want for that price is durability, which I really don\\'t think I am getting with these!  We can all go buy knock-offs of the style for a fraction of the price if style is all you really care about.  Comes with a 1 year limited warranty (you ever try to get a sunglass company to honor their warranty?)Update: 10/7/13: Scratch the good lens comment.  These get oily/dirty easy and are hard to clean.  The silk cleaning cloth does okay, but you really need soap and water to get them clean.  Also, one of the rubber nose pieces came off while on my motorcycle when I had my shield open...lost it.  I had to order a replacement set that comes with replacement rubber ear pieces for about $18. I used some crazy glue and glued them on this time!Update: 6/30/2014: On my second set of rubber nose pieces.  They just don\\'t want to stay on, even with crazy glue....while you can wear them without the rubber pieces, it can get irritating.  Done with these sunglasses!!!!', 1310: \"Wasn't like I want, but it's good, and you has to change the carrier, they just drops the box in front door and don't care if someone else take it.\", 1311: 'Ok, yes these sunglasses look nice and have great lenses. But let\\'s be honest they are freaking sunglasses people! I play hockey and wear a half visor. An Oakley visor. Oakley Pro- straight small visor with forest green/white Oakley logo in the corner, very nice visor. Has the Oakley optics for true vision and an amazing anti -fog coating. The visor is basically a very large lenses treated with the same thisgs these sunglasses are. But it is designed to take a puck going 98mph, or a stick to the face and not break or scratch (much). Drop a pair of Oakley sunglasses and see how they last. But here is the kicker! My visor, which is more impact resistant and scratch resistant (by far) then these sunglasses, cost $80.00. damn near half of the price of these and more than half of some of the other models. So why are people paying that much for sunglasses? This company ( though they make good products like I said I love my hockey visor) is charging obscene prices for their name on sunglasses that are just a tad better then what you can buy at Wal-Mart. Even looking at the lenses you can buy as replacements. Why are they charging so much for them? Will they stop a puck? Absolutely not. But they know people will pay for the name. I think I will stick to the visor but shop for sunglasses where they are actually worth the money. And for those who will say something like \"oh you just don\\'t know how good they really are\" I own a pair of half jacket 2.0 oval polarized lenses, and I feel like I have been completely ripped off.', 1312: 'Fire Iridium,  but frame is look like cheap.Design is good', 1313: \"Seems like the genuine item, but these feel like cheap plastic $10 glasses.  The lenses are nice and clear, but the glasses themselves don't feel like they'd last long.\", 1314: \"A nice pair of good Oakley sunglasses for cheap. Great deal.I have owned over 20 pairs of Oakleys in my lifetime. All of them were great. I don't know if it was just this model but them are incredibly cheap. Made cheaply. After only wearing them a day the rubber around the earpiece has started to stretch out. The frame is uneven. The screws look plastic which seems like its causing it to be uneven. Would never order these again. The only reason I didn't search for a refund was because of the lenses. Amazing lenses that are perfect for me when I do my cycling.\", 1315: 'I love the glasses however I picked this seller due to the fact they show a &#34;Hard Case&#34; for the glasses. There are 3 picture, 1 of which is the hard case; upon arrival no hard case.

I believe part of this is due to the difference in the nose bridge as a component in the locking mechanism.

Finally, I worked overtime, saved-up cash, and bought the nice White frame/Jade green lens RadarLocks. With cleaning solution for additioanl $10 and taxes, I paid about $250. Heck I dont spend that kind of money on a suit.While purchasing it, I noticed that the packaging included everything but a retainer (croakies). Knowing that I will use it for active sports and needed to protect this expensive purchase, I asked for croakies even if I had to pay extra. I was amazed to find out that Oakley store didnt carry/sell retainers (croakies). They had tons of other stuff in the store but no croakies. I had decided that I would go by another store to pick one up later.My first week into wearing them,I dropped the glasses on the floor I took my baseball cap off. And low and behold, a mere 3 ft drop on a bathroom floor scratched the lense. How is that my $20 Walmart sunglasses never scratched from falls during sporting event but these Oakleys scratched so easily.I took them back to the local Oakley store (Bellevue, WA)which claimed that if you're not satified, bring them back with the receipt and packaging and get a refund. When I walked into the store with the Oakley bag in my hand, I saw a frown taking over the manager's (Kylee) face. She was quick and stern about refusal to return or exchange. After much pleading, she generously offered to sell me another pair or another lens at a full retail price. God bless her heart.So, now I have a $250 pair that I can't use after one week of ownership. The only recourse I have is to spend another $85 for a replacement lense which is highly likely to scratch. And I discovered why Oaley doesn't include/sell croakies for sunglasses made for active sports. I will give them 5 stars for sticking it to their customers.\", 1351: \"I'm returning them today. Either Oakley has no quality control, or I received a used pair. There's paint chipped off of the frames, and black marks on the frames as well. The Ice lenses aren't what I'd hoped they'd be either.

But when I handle them to place on my face or to put away back in its case, I get this feeling as if the lenses are due to fall out at any given time. I am not impressed with the Oakley frame.

The sticker is something I wont bother with. Otherwise its ok.', 1363: \"I fell in love with the way this bag looks from the instant I seen it. Even though its a little more expensive I purchased the stealth black bag. There is no denying this is a fantastic looking bag. It gets attention everywhere it goes. The size of it is impressive. For an EDC bag I really couldn't ask for more space. Up until I found this bag I carried an all black The North Face Surge Daypack - Men's for almost a year.I have a bit of an obsession with backpacks of all kinds. I don't typically shell out $200 for one though. I honestly might have ruined this bag for myself. I had super high expectations for a bag made by Oakley and with this price tag. While the quality, look and space of the bag all met my already high expectations. The layout, pocket design and the overall EDC capabilities of this bag really left me disappointed. The bag for what your paying really leaves a lot to be desired.The pocket layout might be one of the worst I've seen. You can get more practical use out of a pillow case with a knot tied in it. There is no dedicated pocket for a water bottle. I guess the two pockets on either side could be used for water. But that just doesn't make any sense to me. Why would I want to unzip a pocket, take a drink, re-zip the pocket? This is basically the overall theme of the backpack. Anytime you want to get in and out of the bag, you have to unbuckle it, flip over the top flap then unzip it. Now because of the overall lack of any organization pockets I now have to fish for whatever your looking for then replace the top flap, re-zip then re-buckle.. 5 minutes later You realize you need something else... And the cycle continues. After a few days of carrying this I just left it unbuckled and then eventually unzipped. So the whole idea of carrying a backpack to keep my things secured was basically put on hold due to the hassle of going in and out of the bag. Its not a good backpack for an EDC. And its too expensive to be considered for anything else. Its not a real contender in any category of bag that I can see. There are much better options for EDC out there at a much lower price point. It is huge but because of the hassle that you have to go through to get in and out of it. Using it as a BOB is out of the question. Maybe the one nitch this bag might have. If you need something to be secure and difficult to get to. That would be this bag. But for almost every other practical application of ANY backpack. Getting in and out of it constantly is kind of the idea.I returned the bag for a refund. If you want my advice stick with a company that is known for making amazing backpacks already. You will probably find them to be better suited for your needs. I will go back to my North Face Surge and wait for something else to come along. Maybe something from maxpedition.***EDIT***I forgot to mention the carry handle in my initial review and its important enough to point something up. If you didn't know already the carry handle is very heavy duty (awesome quality again). The bad thing about that is you have a solid metal bar digging into the back of your neck when your wearing the bag. It made it so that if I wore the backpack correctly I couldnt even look upward because of the contact with the carry handle. Or I could wear the bag improperly and let is sag down my back a bit and then the bag bounces and rubs when it should not. Another major design flaw in this bag. IMHO.\", 1364: \"too small and too thin I tried to out anything and it still wouldn't fit at all so it's a no\", 1365: \"Black and red are my son's school colors and this was going to be the PERFECT backpack for him!

It went from a cushiony, firm material that gripped your head to a mushy almost play-doh like consistency.The problem is, Oakley doesn't sell these temples separately.

In addition to maintaining an active workout schedule, I coach my son's little football and baseball teams.  I own the 3 pairs of Oakley Flak Jackets in 3 different colors.  I love them because of their indestructibility, modular design and readily available parts (lenses, temples and nose pieces), so I jumped at the opportunity to purchase these Crosslinks at a local Optometry practice, thinking the same would be true as well.I've been wearing Crosslinks off and on for months, mostly in the office.  When paired with Transition XTRActive lenses they look and feel great! The temples (arms that hold the frames to your head) are easily interchangeable for a game-time look when there is little time to spare, and each pair comes standard with an extra set of temples in a different color.After about 2 months of ownership, I began experiencing problems with the miniature metal pins that hold the temples in place with loosening and falling out.  Luckily, I haven't lost one yet!  I even stopped wearing them for 3 months, opting for my contacts instead, until I could find a solution to this problem, or I depleted my supply of contact lenses.  After doing the latter, I did finally fix the problem by using a thin pointed phillips head screw driver to force each pin into a locked position.  It's been a month since I did this, and neither pin has moved.Also, the silicon parts on both temples that are designed to resist perspiration and maintain their hold to your head do break down and begin to split, crack and loosen.  I found a spare set on eBay in my flat black frame color, but they cost me $50 plus shipping.  This is definitely a materials flaw.  I've searched for aftermarket replacements, but I haven't found any probably because the Crosslinks are not nearly as popular as some of their other styles of sunglasses.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, but unlike some of Oakley's more popular modular sunglasses models, I would have passed on them if I was aware that these issues existed prior to purchasing them.  By the way, I've read about some horror stories with Oakley's Customer and Warranty Claims Services Units, so I decided to bypass this step and address the issues on my own.\", 1406: 'the lens does not have the same product descption it will reach the destination changed the poor quality lens that says made &#8203;&#8203;in chinaplastic framecompound lensunpolarizedLens Width: 53 mmLens height: 30.5Bridge: 17 mmArm: 140 mmFrame Color: Satin Black / BlackSize: 53-17-140Crosslink Oakley Prescription RX FrameActive Crosslink Oakley Prescription RX Frame for Men', 1407: 'love this glasses.... but the ear sock material tend to soak up oil excreted from body overtime and start to disintegrate in 4 to 6 months....

These glasses are designed so that the arm can easily be taken off and replaced with a new arm.  That's great and that's one of the reasons why I purchased them.  The BIG problem is that it's impossible to find the replacement arms.  I contacted Oakley and they do not sell just the arms at the moment.  You must have it repaired under warranty or buy the whole frame.  What's the point of buying the whole frame if the design is capable of interchanging arms.

The footbed material is fraying already, too, around the toes so much so that I thought of returning them but decided against doing so since I wear them a lot and can\\'t reconcile the wear and tear I put into them without SOME amount of degradation.  This being said: their OK for occasional use, maybe even frequent use but remember that the footbed will retain odors (see: don\\'t let them stay wet), and expect fraying/decay of the rubber that is at the toes that connects the footbed to the lug(what you walk on).

I recommend going somewhere and trying on different sun glasses and making sure you like the fit before you order a pair blindly. Your facial structure would have to be sunk in where the frames do not sit on your cheeks or you have an extremely long nose which would prevent the sunglasses from resting on your cheeks. :) Costly Lesson learned! The guy with the stellar five star review beside me must have been a rep for Oakley or they modeled his face for these sunglasses, or possibly Dad and Mom purchased them for him (probably the latter.)

That sounded good to me. However, now that I've got them, I can't see any improvement for really bright conditions compared to other Oakley (and other brands) that I've tried. These are fine; but I expected strong protection from these lenses and they don't really deliver. Driving into direct morning sun and driving home at night with the sun setting off to my front-left overpowers these lenses. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but these lenses are advertised as being for 'intense sunlight  conditions'; that's what I needed, and they are not 100% up to the task.

Because the lens wouldn't stay in, it ended up getting a huge scratch and they are virtually ruined because of the large scratch and I don't trust them.

For example, they don't have serial numbers or writing on the inside of the arms. They also lack that signature Oakley &#34;Click&#34; when opening the arms up. The hinges are just basic ball and socket hinges that are featured in the cheapest of sunglasses. I feel that the Frogskins are the most &#34;basic&#34; Oakley's you can get because of this.The lenses are also not as advanced as the majority of other Oakley shades. The lenses do NOT feature the High Definition Optics (HDO) that almost all other Oakley's come with. They also don't feature the &#34;Three Point Fit&#34; system. The lenses feel cheaper and on the Iridium models I have had problems with the finish chipping off the edges of the lenses. I can understand that Oakley is trying to stay close to their roots with their first highly popular pair of sunglasses, but in all honesty, they haven't updated much since they came out in the 1970's. The only bigger difference is the O-Matter frame, which is a nylon plastic. This helps with durability.Sizing is also a bit small. I have a bigger head and they don't fit right.In conclusion, these Oakley's are the base pair of sunglasses and are not worth as much as other more advanced Oakley models. They need a update in order to justify the price. I would only consider getting these glasses if you can find an Authentic pair for under $65.\", 1560: 'The lenses of these glasses are very nice, and they appear as pictured online, however the plastic used to create the frames feels VERY cheap.

I need the polarized lenses more than i need his name etched in Japanese on the front of the lens. Amazon needs to be more careful.

This trouble was resolved after a bit of back and forth with the seller, who eventually DID accept my return. Overall, not the greatest experience, but not the worst either. Definitely a reasonable seller, just ALWAYS read the return policy for any private seller.Thanks to the comments below, I appreciate the corrections as well as the prompt fix since I have been a bit busy to change my review since the return had been completed.

Oakley was about to tell me that they were clearance since they were on the Vault site, and not allow me a return, but I told them they should really put a warning on how big they are in comparison to other models and that they may be larger than normal.

It's clear that a great deal of thought went into the development of these sunglasses, as their blanket UV protection, flexible frame, form-fitting materials, and sleek accenting reveal.  If this were all there was to it, I'd say these were handily a 4-5star product.  However, let me emphasize a significant con that cannot be overstated: these sunglasses are HUGE.  If you have a normal or smallish face, these sunglasses will look far too large for your features.  If that's the kind of thing you enjoy, then ignore this con, but at this price level, I would expect something with a little more broad appeal, at least within the marketplace of people willing to fork over a few c-notes for sunglasses.Personally, even though I acquired these from Amazon at a sale price of $321, I ended up returning them, as they looked garishly large on me (and I'm perhaps above the normal end of the spectrum when it comes to the proportions of my face).  They were comfortable, and appeared well-made, but no matter how much technology they've crammed into a pair of sunglasses, it's all for naught if one shells out $600 and the fit isn't 100% becoming.If these sunglasses fit your face and you don't mind parting with the money, I would wager these sunglasses would not disappoint.  That being said, there's only a particular subset of person on whom these sunglasses will appear at home, regardless of whether or not you're keen on spending the $.So there you have it.

Every time I put on a pair of Ray-Bans, they are perfect, the lenses are crystal clear with no distortion, no curvature, very clean polarization.  I bought this pair of TwoFace thinking that they look as flat as any Oakleys available, and even these lenses have curved distortion, and to top it off, they are too dark and with not enough polarization. I would have thought that with the mirror-coating these would have strong polarization but it does not, it's very weak polarization.

It may be just from the way they put the lenses in, but who knows. My eye doctor is ordering a replacement.Aesthetically, these eye glasses really look great and are an attention getter. They are very light, and don't slip at all like my previous glasses. This is interesting because they don't even wrap around the ear. These feel very cutting edge as for as the engineering when you wear them. The eyeglasses included a case and an extra (boring) set of black ear socks (which I'll use to replace the Retina Burn when they wear out in three months).I just hope they hold up to mild sports stress (road biking, gym, etc.).

Or maybe this was manufactured in China ( i have read in some forums that Oakley is already making some of their products in China.Comparing it further with  my older frame, everything else looks . The quality  of the workmanship is excellent. Frame details like model name, model number including lens + arm  + bridge numbers are there where you expect them to be and are nicely done.I swapped  the demo lens with my prescription lens from my old frame . The Iens fit perfectly on the frame.  have been wearing this new frame for days now. So far I have nothing to complain.Is this an authentic product ? The seller says so.. I think it is , i hope so.Would i recommend this product / seller ?  - for the price that i paid , yeah i would recommend the seller and product to  a friend.', 1658: 'Incorrect photos. The frame is not 100% black, it has gray on the sides. Amazon needs to update their photos.', 1659: \"I'm 5'10, small chested, slim build.  I purchased a small.  It was actually loose around the abdomen, arms, and chest.  (Not as fitted as in the picture.) It looked cute on. I had to return it, however, because it was too small in the armpit area. Specifically, it's as though the arm holes were cut too small.  This is really strange, because I have very small shoulders.  The strange cut in the shoulders made it very uncomfortable to wear.  Perhaps I could order a medium, but I think I won't.  I will probably look for a different brand.\", 1660: 'All Oakleys (real Oakleys) are made in the US.  I had an expert look at this product and it is fake fake fake.', 1661: \"Went to register my Oakley's & was told by them that this was not an authorized dealer & even if they are authentic they aren't covered. Oakley's inability to control sales channels on the internet is a price consumers now pay. Will not buy Oakley again as popular as they are without a warranty they aren't worth the price.I've owned several pairs & they always break except the flak jackets.\", 1662: 'They look good in internet,wen they came home they ware poorly made you can get a better quality at any gas station for a cutter of the price', 1663: \"Before buying it, I thought it was made by USA.I didn't confirm origin mark.I wanted to buy frogskins that was made by USA.\", 1664: \"This product, which was in use!Seller lied to me. I bought a new Oakley. But the old box, no label, no protection. I'm upset. It was a very bad experience.\", 1665: 'Quite disapointed in the style. Not Oakley distinct enough. The Oakley name at the bridge isfaint. The lenses are so dark it is hard to see. The top of  the lenses steam upplaying golf in Florida where I live. I have better styled sunglasses from Maxx for $20.00.You can get Maxx glasses at any prro shop.'}\n"
